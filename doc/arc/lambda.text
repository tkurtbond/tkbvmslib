       Data and procedures and the values they amass,
       Higher-order functions to combine and mix and match,
       Objects with their local state, the messages they pass,
       A property, a package, the control point for a catch---
       In the Lambda Order they are all first-class.
       One Thing to name them all, One Thing to define them,
       One Thing to place them in environments and bind them,
       In the Lambda Order they are all first-class.
