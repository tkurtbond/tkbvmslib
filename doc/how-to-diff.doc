                              How to create a diff

    To create a diff to be sent to Geoff Huston, you use the DIFF program
with the "-C" option to create a "context diff" which will have a good chance
of working even if someone has made a local change to their source.

    Let's walk through an example.  Say I added a nifty change to NEWSPOST.C.
I want to send it to Geoff to be included in the next patchlevel of NEWS.

    So here's a directory:

          Directory PERM$2:[CONSLT32.WORK]

          NEWSPOST.C;2        NEWSPOST.C;1

          Total of 2 files.

    To create the diff, I just use the form "DIFF -C oldfile newfile".  One
important thing, though, is to make the newer filename shorter than the older
one.  I just do this by specifying the version number on the old version, but
not on the new one.

    First, set up a foreign symbol for DIFF if you haven't:

            $ DIFF :== $disk:[directory]DIFF

    To create the diff:

            $ DEFINE/USER SYS$OUTPUT DIFF.TXT   ! Filename of the diff
            $ DIFF -C NEWSPOST.C;1 NEWSPOST.C

Here's what the sample output looks like, in this case:

---------------------------------------------------------------

     *** newspost.c;-1                           <-- Old filename
     --- newspost.c                              <-- New one, should be shorter
     **************                              <-- Start of first patch
     *** 137,142                                 <-- Section from old file
                *msg;
       {
           char mail_cmd[IO_SIZE];
  
           err_line(msg);  
           if (screen_active) {
     --- 137,143 -----                           <-- Section from new file
                *msg;
       {
           char mail_cmd[IO_SIZE];
     +     int added_var;                        <-- '+' means added line
  
           err_line(msg);  
           if (screen_active) {
     **************                              <-- Start of second patch
     *** 151,156
               smg$begin_pasteboard_update(&pid);
               broad_trap();
               }
           clear_err_line();
       }
       #endif
     --- 152,158 -----
               smg$begin_pasteboard_update(&pid);
               broad_trap();
               }
     +     doit(added_var);                     <-- Added call to doit()
           clear_err_line();
       }
       #endif

That's about it.  If you have more than one file changed, you can create
diffs for each and append them together - patch will do multiple files
at once.

    Check your patch to make sure it looks right, and it's set to go!

                                Applying a patch

   To apply a patch, you must first extract it to a file.  You shouldn't
have to worry about editing the header from the top, because patch will
ignore it.

   Set up a foreign symbol for patch, i.e.

          $ PATCH :== $disk:[directory]PATCH

then, set your default directory to wherever the affected files are,
and invoke PATCH:

          $ PATCH <DIFF.TXT               ! DIFF.TXT is the diff

notice, please, that there's no space between the '<' and the filename.

    Patch will print progress messages and (hopefully) patch your files.
Occasionally, enough of a change will have been made locally that a patch
will fail.  If this happens, PATCH creates a filename with the name of the
file and "_REJ" appended to it.  You'll have to use an editor to apply
rejected patches by hand.  Hopefully, patches won't be rejected often.

    Here's a sample PATCH log from the patch above:

         $ patch <diff.txt
         Hmm...  Looks like a context diff to me...
         The text leading up to this was:
         --------------------------
         |*** newspost.c;-1
         |--- newspost.c
         --------------------------
         Patching file newspost.c using Plan B...
         Hunk #1 succeeded at 137.
         Hunk #2 succeeded at 152.
         done

    So, it's fairly simple!  This guide, though, is just an introductory
text.  Have a look at both PATCH.DOC and DIFF.DOC, realizing that some
of the things they talk about are Unix-only, for more information.
