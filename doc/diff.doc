NAME
     diff - Public Domain diff (context diff) program

SYNOPSIS
     diff [ -b -c -i -e ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
     Diff compares two files, showing what must be changed to
     make them identical. Either file1 or file2 (but not both)
     may refer to directories. If that is the case, a file in the
     directory whose name is the same as the other file argument
     will be used. The standard input may be used for one of the
     files by replacing the argument by "-". Except for the stan-
     dard input, both files must be on disk devices.

OPTIONS
     -b Remove trailing whitespace (blanks and tabs) and compress
          all other strings of whitespace to a single blank.

     -c Print some context -- matching lines before and after the
          non-match section.  Mark non-matched sections with "|".

     -i Ignore lower/upper case distinctions.

     -e Output is in an "editor script" format which is compati-
          ble with the Unix 'ed' editor.

     All information needed to compare the files is maintained in
     main memory. This means that very large files (or fairly
     large files with many differences) will cause the program to
     abort with an "out of space" message. Main memory require-
     ments (in words) are approximately:

               2 * (length of file1 + length of file2)
                      + 3 * (number of changes)

     (Where "length" is the number of lines of data in each
     file.)

     The algorithm reads each file twice, once to build hash
     tables and once to check for fortuitous matches (two lines
     that are in fact different, but which have the same hash
     value). CPU time requirements include sorting the hash
     tables and randomly searching memory tables for equivalence
     classes. For example, on a time-shared VAX-11/780, comparing
     two 1000 line files required about 30 seconds (elapsed clock
     time) and about 10,000 bytes of working storage. About 90
     per-cent of the time was taken up by file I/O.

     Warning, bad option 'x'
          The option is ignored.

     Usage ...
          Two input files were not specified.

     Can't open input file "filename".
          Can't continue.

     Out of space
          The program ran out of memory while comparing the two
          files.

     Can't read line nnn at xxx in file[A/B]
          This indicates an I/O error when seeking to the
          specific line.  It should not happen.

     Spurious match, output is not optimal.
          Two lines that were different yielded the same hash
          value.  This is harmless except that the difference
          output is not the minimum set of differences between
          the two files.  For example, instead of the output:
                     lines 1 to 5 were changed to ...
          the program will print
                     lines 1 to 3 were changed to ...
                     lines 4 to 5 were changed to ...

     The program uses a CRC16 hash code.
          The likelihood of this error is quite small.

     The diff algorithm was developed by J. W. Hunt and M. D.
     McIlroy, using a central algorithm defined by H. S. Stone.

BUGS
     On RSX and DECUS C on VMS systems, diff may fail if the both
     files are not "variable-length, implied carriage control"
     format.  The scopy program can be used to convert files to
     this format if problems arise.

     When compiled under VAX C, diff handles STREAM_LF files
     properly (in addition to the canonical variable-length
     implied carriage control files). Other variations should
     work, but have not been tested.

DIFF(1)             UNIX Programmer's Manual              DIFF(1)



     When compiled under VAX C, diff is quite slow for unknown
     reasons which ought to be investigated. On the other hand,
     it has access to effectively unlimited memory.

     Output in a form suitable for ed - the -e option - seems
     rather pointless; the analogue on DEC systems is SLP (SUMSLP
     on VMS). It would be simple to provide SLP-compatible out-
     put. The question is, why bother - since the various DEC
     file comparison utilities already produce it.
