			GNU EMACS PATCHES FOR VMS
			      version 2.1.5

			   Created 15-NOV-1992

	These are a set of patches which makes VMS work a lot
	better. Among the additions and changes are:

		- DECWindows interfacing
		- Pseudo-ttys
		- Subprocesses a la UNIX
		- Networking a la UNIX
		- Better handling of VMS files and directories,
		  with completion of both file names and directories.
		- Display of 8-bit characters (I've use the works of
		  Howard Gayle.)

	To get these patches, just send a message to fileserv@ttt.kth.se
	with this line:

		SEND EMACS-1858-PATCHES

	This set of patches is around 1Mb worth.

	To be able to apply the patches in this kit, you need the UNIX
	patch for VMS. You may get it by adding the following line to
	your message:

		SEND DIFF-PATCH

	That kit is also available on most VMS archive sites.

	Also, these patches are a continuously evolving project. Bug
	fixes and further enhancement are provided as soon as possible.
	Send this line to fileserv@ttt.kth.se for more info:

		LIST EMACS-1858-UPDATES

	Some packages have also been fixed/built to work on VMS.
	For example GNUS 3.14.1 (Which I'm using from my VMS account
	at this very moment).

Subject: MacGambit version of Thomas now available
Reply-To: straz@cambridge.apple.com


From: Steve Strassmann <straz@cambridge.apple.com>

With many thanks to Marc Feeley, a version of Thomas for the Mac
is now available. This is based on MacGambit 1.9.1, the Mac
implementation of the Gambit Scheme interpreter and compiler.
Version 1.9.1 has several enhancements, including online help for
R^4 scheme.

Marc has made available not just the sources to Gambit, but a
special version customized as a Thomas interpreter. Thomas is
a compiler written at Digital Equipment Corporation's Cambridge
Research Laboratory. Thomas compiles a language compatable with the
language described in Apple's Dylan manual.

These files are now available by anonymous ftp from these sites:

  trex.iro.umontreal.ca    /pub/gambit/gambit1.9.1/
  cambridge.apple.com      /pub/dylan/gambit/

----------
Content:

macgambit-1.9.1-interp.hqx     MacGambit interpreter only
macgambit-1.9.1-sources1.hqx   THINK-C 5.0 sources files for interpreter
macgambit-1.9.1-sources2.hqx   Rest of sources for compiler
macgambit-1.9.1-thomas.hqx     Standalone interpreter for DEC's Thomas system

Note: all of these files are (c) 1992, Universite de Montreal.  Check the
"About MacGambit" dialog box for details.

MacGambit version 1.9.1 is now available via anonymous FTP from
trex.iro.umontreal.ca in the pub/gambit/gambit1.9.1 directory.  The
interpreter AND THINK-C 5.0 sources to the whole system (including the
compiler) are there.  There is also a version of MacGambit linked with
DEC's Thomas system release 1.1.

All of these programs are now in the public domain and may be
distributed to others as long as they are not sold or transferred for
compensation (other than a reasonable duplication fee).  The copyright
notice must also remain with the programs.

Please understand that these programs are the result of an UNFUNDED
group at the Universite de Montreal.  Users who enjoy the system
should consider sending a donation to our group so that we can fund
students to continue improving MacGambit.  Corporate funding is of
course welcome!

---------------
For the Thomas version I added code that throws the user back to the
toplevel Thomas REPL when an error occurs.  I also added a "load"
method that calls thomas->scheme on a file and then calls the Scheme
load procedure to load it in.

Reports say that Clinton is considering John "Look and Feel" Sculley,
CEO of Apple, for the office of Secretary of Commerce.  The League for
Programming Freedom urges all programmers to write to the Clinton
office to oppose this.

We are not supplying sample wording because politicians pay more
attention to a letter if you wrote it yourself.

You'll find it easy to write your own letter if you don't try to make
it perfect.  It's not for publication, after all, so it doesn't need
to be good literature.  Instead, write it quickly and send it.

Keep the letter short; just one page, and not small print either.
Otherwise they won't read it.

Send your letter to

Office of the President-Elect
Atkins Building
105 West Capital Street,  Suite 400
Little Rock,  Arkansas   72201

If you can spare a little extra time, address a second copy to Robert
Reich at that same address.

Reports are that this decision will be made soon.  If you can afford
it, send telegrams instead of letters; they will arrive sooner.  Or
phone the office at (501) 374-3322, ask for their fax number, and fax
your letter before mailing it.  (Don't substitute a phone call for
something in writing; a written letter carries much more weight than a
phone call.)

But don't worry about whether you will be "too late".  These letters
will have a good effect even if they arrive too late for this
particular decision, even if Clinton has already chosen a Secretary of
Commerce, because they will call attention to the overall issue of too
much intellectual property.


Here are some points you might want to mention.  (You need not mention
them all.)

* Software development is important to the US economy.

* Software developers need relief from the unnecessary and unasked-for
new kinds of intellectual property, such as software patents and
overbroad interpretations of copyright.

* Barrons, Forbes and The Economist have agreed that software patents
are bad for business.

* Clinton has said that the post of Secretary of Commerce is very
important.  We agree.  Dept of Commerce policies are very important to
software developers.

* The Secretary of Commerce is in charge of the Patent Office,
which plagues us with patented features and patented techniques
for manipulating data.

* The Secretary of Commerce is in charge of trade negotiations;
GATT threatens to block most routes for improving the patent system.

* Sculley as CEO of Apple, with his "look and feel" lawsuit, is trying
to twist the law to create an unprecedented broad kind of monopoly
that would be bad for computer users and for most software developers.

* Such a person should not be put in charge of the policies for
software development or any industry.

LMServ is an ad hoc server written in VAX/VMS DCL by Loren Miller. You
may place commands within the subject line and/or the body of the mail
message. Blank lines will be ignored, as will any line that looks like a
header (e.g. starts with "From:", or "Received:"). The server reads the
subject line, then the lines of your mail message in order. If it comes
across a command it does not recognize, it will ignore the rest of the
commands and send you the help file.

When you request multiple items in one message, this server will append
all the files you request together and send them all to you in a single
mail message. There are no provisions to split them up into manageable
files so you will have to make sure that you request them in a
combination that is acceptable for your e-mail path.

The server is NOT case sensitive. Uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case
command lines will all be processed correctly.

A Hint: instead of using a filler subject line, leave it blank or put a
LMServ command on it.

LMServ can take requests to be added to or deleted from a mailing list.
It can also send out files from a mailing list archive area. It can also
dispense help for itself, and it can supply a directory listing for the
archive area. It does not accept files for submission to the archive
area.

You may subscribe to the GRASS mailing list, but you do not need to join
it in order to retrieve items from the archive area. If all you want to
do is read what we write, and you don't want to add your own work, then
don't join.

If you have material which you would like to submit for the archive
area, send a valid internet mail message to GRASS@wharton.upenn.edu.  It
will be sent to the entire GRASS mailing list and will automatically be
inserted into the current bundle of archives.

If you have material which you would like to submit to the archives
without distributing it directly to the GRASS mailing list, send it,
with your request, to MILLERL@wharton.upenn.edu and it will be
considered for inclusion in the GRASS archive area.

If you have any comments or complaints on the way the server works
please send them to MILLERL@wharton.upenn.edu

If you desire to install LMServ at your location you must be on a
VAX/VMS system running Ned Freed's PMDF Internet mail delivery program,
with PMDF/DELIVER also enabled, and you must be friendly with your
system manager, as parts of the implementation require access to a
privileged account.

HELP is for the present under near-constant revision.

(1)           VMS (and by contagion, LMServ) requires all filenames to
              be specified by name and by extension, including the
              period separating the two parts, even with wildcards. So
              in order to specify "agenda.current" with a wildcard, type
              "agenda.*" instead of "agenda*".

Subject: A Tiny MOP, in Scheme


This message will be of interest to: (i) People who are interested in
metaobject protocols, particularly metaobject protocols for Lisp-based
object-oriented languages; and (ii) people who are interested in Lisp-
based object-oriented languages like CLOS and Dylan.  In this message,
we announce the public availability of the Scheme implementation of a
`kernelized' CLOS, with a metaobject protocol.  (If you are interested
only in OO languages, and not metaobject protocols, you can skip the
third, fourth and fifth paragraphs of this message.)

One stumbling block for people interested in playing with the metaobject
protocol (MOP) ideas has been the relative complexity of working in
Common Lisp.  This has been a particular obstacle for undergraduates and
others who normally work in Scheme (or a very reduced Common Lisp).  To
try and address this, we have designed and implemented a Scheme
embedding of a core subset of CLOS, with a corresponding core MOP.

Since our primary goal is pedagogical in nature, we have been able to
produce an extremely lean language, MOP and implementation.  The
implementation is even simpler than the simple CLOS found in `The Art of
the Metaobject Protocol,' weighing in at around 850 lines of code,
including (some) comments and documentation.

By making the new language and MOP be the core of CLOS and the CLOS MOP,
rather than some completely new language, our goal was to make possible
for people to work with existing written materials -- primarily `The Art
of the Metaobject Protocol' (AMOP) -- when playing with this system.
(It should also be possible for people working with Tiny CLOS to get
value from reading papers about others MOPs, such as ABLC/R, 3KRS and
others.)  A side benefit of this approach is that Tiny CLOS is close to
a core of Dylan, so people interested in that language may find value in
playing with Tiny CLOS as well.)

The MOP in Tiny CLOS is very simple -- 8 introspective procedures and 9
intercessory generics -- but it retains much of the power of both of the
MOPs found in AMOP.  Even though the Tiny CLOS implementation itself
isn't optimized, this MOP is amenable to optimization, using techniques
like those mentioned in AMOP.  In fact, the slot access protocol used in
this MOP is such that it should be possible to get better performance
than is possible with the CLOS MOP.

While it isn't our primary goal, Tiny CLOS can also be used by those who
are simply intereted in CLOS/Dylan style OO languages.  That is, you can
play with the base language without even thinking about the MOP.  A
great deal has already been said and written about how to learn, think
about and teach OOP and CLOS-like languages, so we won't say any more
about that.  But, it is important to point out a significant difference
between Tiny CLOS and CLOS/Dylan.  In Tiny CLOS, slot names are not
required to be symbols, they can be any Scheme datum (object).  (They
are compared using eq?.)  This means that one can use the lexical
scoping mechanisms of Scheme to achieve a greater degree of
encapsulation than is possible in CLOS.  For more on this, see the
second and third examples in the examples file.

Accompanying Tiny CLOS is a file of examples, that show how the base
language works, and how to use the MOP to do several common extensions.
Other things people might want to write are: before and after methods,
slot filling initargs, beta-like languages, singleton methods etc.

To make distribution simple, Tiny CLOS is available by anonymous ftp
from parcftp.xerox.com:/pub/mops.  There are five files of interest:


 tiny-annouce.text  This message.

 support.scm        Just a bunch of useful stuff.
                    (All implementation specific mods (are supposed
                    to) go in here.)
 tiny-clos.scm      The main program.
 tiny-examples.scm  A few little examples of using this language
                    and this MOP.
 tiny-rpp.text      The reflective processor program for this
                    MOP.  This file was generated, by hand, from
                    tiny-clos.scm by removing all the code that
                    deals with bootstrapping or grounding out
                    the tower.  That is, this is the code/protocol
                    that you should `think of' as running at the
                    next level, when ignoring issues of circularity.


MIT Scheme 11.74 is the only Scheme we have access to, so that is the
only Scheme in which we have run this stuff.  But, it should run with
only minor mods in other Schemes as well.  (Please send us those mods
so they can be included in the sources!)


This language, this MOP, and this implementation should not be treated
as any sort of finished product.  This whole thing was cranked out
relatively quickly, in response to an immediate need for simplified
Scheme embeddings of this stuff.  We are very interested in any
suggestions or improvements you might have or make.  So, please send
them in!

(It is also worth knowing that this is the first Scheme program I have
written in 10 years, so I'm willing to believe I have a lot to learn
about good Scheme style.  Rather than just snickering, please let me
know about stupid things this code does in that regard.)

One other note.  You will notice that these files have a copyright
notice on them, as is the fashion these days.  It isn't copyleft, it is
somewhat more liberal than that.  If you have any questions about it,
send us mail.

Finally, please let us know if you decide to play with this stuff, and
if you want to be on the mops@parc.xerox.com mailing list.  (Note,
please don't use this mailing list for adminstrative stuff.  It is for
technical questions and discussions.  For administrative stuff, send
mail to Gregor@parc.xerox.com.)

-----------------------> You asked about GRASS. What is it all about?

GRASS
  Generic Religions and Secret Societies
  GRASS@wharton.upenn.edu

  GRASS (Generic Religions And Secret Societies) is a working group
  formed in order to write up brief descriptions of various religions
  and initiatory societies for whatever purposes you like, with the
  emphasis on use in roleplaying games. As is only natural given the
  subject matter, we have an initiatory requirement. Before being
  admitted to the group you must submit something of value to it. We
  suggest using a standard format (which may be found on
  grass-server@wharton.upenn.edu in grass.format), and placing your
  writeup in the public domain. Get a copy of GRASS.FORMAT and write up
  an organization with which you are familiar, or submit a substantial
  amount of constructive commentary on a writeup that already exists.

  Administrivia (requests to join, leave, etcetera) may be sent to
  the grass server at the following address(es):

           GRASS-SERVER@wharton.upenn.edu

  To join the GRASS mailing list, send a message with either the subject
  line or the first line of the mail message saying:

           SUB Your Name Here

  To quit GRASS say:

           UNSUB Your Name Here

  Instead. Other commands are available. For more complete instructions
  on how to use the server say HELP.

  Actual submissions to the mailing list should be sent to:

           GRASS@wharton.upenn.edu

  archives are located on the grass server.

  List address:   GRASS@wharton.upenn.edu
  Server address: GRASS-SERVER@wharton.upenn.edu

  Admin address:  GRASS-REQUEST@wharton.upenn.edu
             or:  "Loren Miller" <MILLERL@wharton.upenn.edu>

-----------------------> This is the Preferred Format for GRASS articles

[please limit grass essays to 72 columns, as this makes printing on
narrow paper easier, and ensures that they will be deliverable by all
known types of electronic mail software. If you don't want to use a
section of the format, then don't.]

=========================================================================
   An alchemist hires the party to recover a shipment of supplies that
was hijacked enroute.  If he doesn't get them back, he faces bankruptcy.
=========================================================================
   Caught while stealing from a mage, the thief in the party is sent on a
geas to steal an artifact from a colleague as punishment.
=========================================================================
   You are assigned to protect a person, but don't let them know you're
protecting them.  Defer to them in all things, but don't let them know
you're deferring to them.
=========================================================================
   An obscure sect of a dark church is seeking the eight necessary
parts/items used in summoning a sleeping demon. Just so happens that one
of the PCs inherited one of the items (it should be something innocuous
like a simple pendant with inscriptions) from a dead relative.
=========================================================================
   The party uncovers a plot to replace high-ranking officials with exact
lookalikes (shapechangers).  Nice little conspiracy theory action.  Which
one of your trusted patrons is really an evil doppleganger? Who can you
trust? Who will believe you? Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean
someone ISN'T out to get you.
=========================================================================
   The party is hired by the local Mage Guild to find and capture (and/or
kill) a renegade wizard who is breaking Guild laws (selling magic items
to criminals, assassinating the previous Guildmaster, attempting to
assassinate the current Guildmaster, etc.). Local law enforcement is not
involved because the Guild likes to solve its problems internally.
=========================================================================
   There's a battle going on between a good lich and one or more evil
liches.  The players have to protect a town that's caught in the
crossfire.  The lich need not even appear in the campaign; you could just
have dark noxious clouds blotting out the sun, undead armies marching
back and forth, dragons eating the livestock, and other bits of large-
scale magical fallout.  Or, if you want to bring the lich in personally,
you could send the party on a quest to plead with the lich to stop the
war, or to fight elsewhere.
=========================================================================
   PCs get caught in hole (old castle, cave?) with overwhelming numbers
against them. They have some warning and a time period when they will be
relieved if they can hold on. Idea is that PC improvise with what is
around and hold out for siege. Turns the GMing on its head. They have a
plan of defenses, not the GM, and GM leads his baddies against it.
Players spring their surprises in traps etc. Must have a map agreement on
what can be done in time available.  Players tend to cheat outrageously
but great fun for all concerned with a change of pace for both GM and
players.
=========================================================================
   Here's a bunch of REAL short descriptions of adventure ideas that work
well in a city:
   Second-story jobs, picking a pocket and finding a map, searching the
tunnels under the city for a tomb or catacombs, competing with the
Thieves' Guild, smuggling arms into the city, spying on foreign
officials, helping an orphan fight against cruel thugs, racing another
party in a city-wide search for a magical artifact, investigating a
corrupt church, wooing a noble lady, searching for your weapons
instructor who has been abducted by a rival, trying to get apprenticed to
a truly weird mage, etc.
=========================================================================
   Invert the "bad-lich-turns-out-to-be-good" idea:  A really sinister
lich would probably love to have people convinced that he's just a
kindly, helpful old gent.  Suppose one such lich has been working hard on
his image for a century or two...he saves people from natural disasters
(which he created himself), gives out magical gifts (which are cursed in
some nonobvious way), kisses babies, the whole shebang. The players come
to suspect him of actually being evil ("Hey...two centuries old?  That's
before Second Edition came out!  He must be evil!") and have to stop him.
But first, they have to convince the locals, who love the old guy, that
they've been wrong about him all this time. ("Gandalf?  The old coot with
the fireworks?  Evil?  Get outta here.")
=========================================================================
   Go to kill the evil lich, get captured and put at his/its mercy only
to have it ask "Why are you bothering me?"  Apparently it was/is a good
wizard who got kind of absent minded as he died and sort of drifted off
into lichdom without noticing.  Since he's quite powerful, none of the
various local monsters that he's geased into serving him have given him
any trouble, nor have they pointed out the problem of his lichdom...
   Play the lich as an absent minded old british gentleman, sort of
surprised that anybody would want to kill him and having considerable
trouble grasping the idea that he's a lich.  A few accidental pats on the
back while the players are held by some sort of spell should be amusing.
   P.S. If you can't figure out how to set things up so a lich can
capture and hold helpless a bunch of PCs, SHAME on you!  Liches are
something like 30th level M-U/Clerics, not to mention the hordes of
followers, servants, summoned monsters and demons and elementals and the
like...
=========================================================================
   A caravan is travelling through the desert.  The party is hired to
capture a man who is in the caravan, and it must be done quietly, so that
nobody else knows.  They are given the man's name, and the fact that he
is a mage, but no other information about him.  The catch is that the
caravan consists of ten wagons, with at least thirty or forty guards
(when I used this adventure, the caravan was travelling through Brin
Pass, a VERY dangerous area), and everyone's wearing the standard desert
gear: a white robe, with a hood and a veil.  This makes it very difficult
to tell who's who.  The party should investigate the wagons.  If they do,
they will find that only one wagon doesn't have an obvious reason for
existance (i.e. belongs to the caravan master, carries supplies, or
carries cargo).  A man is living in that wagon, and only comes out to get
food.  Raiding the wagon will obviously cause noise and commotion, two
things to be strenuously avoided.  This is a very difficult scenario;
I've run it twice, and both times the party failed.  Once the guy got
killed and the party was arrested and held in custody by the caravan
master, and once the guy ran away and the party lost him.
=========================================================================
                       REWARD
      (very large sum mentioned - for your world)
               BRAVE Adventurers Needed!
  To Kill the DRAGON of Eastmark, Kingdom of Arcadia.
   (fill in location and kingdom name as necessary).
             Apply at the Royal Palace.

   All that made that adventure interesting (aside from the nearly 1000
mile overland journey, differing cultures, side-adventures, et al) was
the fact that the "DRAGON of Eastmark" was a golden dragon, and the party
was mostly Good characters.  The Gold had become insane when humans had
attacked and slain his mate, and spent his time laying waste to the local
kingdom, which finally began posting notes (after the first three
expeditions failed) to hire outsiders to come in and try to destroy the
genius-intelligence, magic-using and physically awe-inspiring dragon.
Since the tattered posting does not mention that the "DRAGON" is a Gold,
the party had already travelled the very long way, and then had a lot of
discussion before finally deciding that grief did not excuse the dragon's
excesses, and that he must be destroyed.
=========================================================================
   Most campaigns have a player who loves to play politics, involve her
in this. Assume for the sake of argument that the goal is the office of
district attorney. Enigma has ambitions to be the DA, the chief force for
justice in Gotham. He is opposed by Buck Stevens, son of the founder of
Stevens Brick Co., which is the second largest employer in Gotham. Darla
Stevens is in love with the Enigma's alter ego, Bing Strawberry, and
keeps telling him he ought to get in politics and make sure her slimy
brother doesn't achieve political office ... etc etc etc you get the
idea.
   Some complications that suggest themselves are:
   a) Enigma discovers that candidates must turn in petitions with 1000
names in order to register for the election, and he blew it off so long
that he needs to get them all *tonight*, to be turned in at 8 am tomorrow
morning (where do you get 1000 valid signatures at this time of the
night?)
   b) the primaries are a good time for enemies to show up with
embarassing photos in hand
   c) election season can be complicated by reporters who circle,
vulture-like, over the troubled campaign HQ, and by a televised public
debate between the candidates
   d) the election and the aftermath -- did the PC win?  What will happen
to the party now?  What if the press finds out about the vampires the
party staked a few years ago in the abandoned buildings in the ghetto?
what about the crook who recognizes Enigma's voice and threatens to
publicise his secret identity?
=========================================================================
   The lich is a good wizard who was forced to become a lich in order to
remain around to counteract some powerful evil force.  He/it spent the
last years of his life directly restraining some powerful evil demon
(make it something not quite physical, for example a demon of madness
that manifests by making victims psychotically insane...evil human
sacrifice cults start springing up all over the place and random people
on the road start attacking out of the blue with no provocation, sort of
like...gasp!  PCs!)
   So the Lich is at the bottom of some dungeon complex using spells and
powers that are so far beyond the party's understanding that they can't
perceive them, to hold the evil imprisoned.  He/it is also keeping random
strangers from wandering in and interfering.  After so long a time, the
lich just sort of drifted into undeath without really noticing (keeping a
set of spells up constantly for years will do that to ya).  The PCs
manage to get the drop on the Lich when he's weakened and...
   a) the evil gets loose.
   b) the good lich's wizardly spirit manifests before it moves on to
another, higher plane, and commends them for their actions in releasing
him from his unwitting servitude to to undeath.  He also says, "Well, I'm
off to my retirement in elysium, the job's all yours, boys!"
   c) If you're feeling charitable, give the players an inkling of what's
going to happen, or some magic to help them to combat the madness demon
(personal protection against the madness would be nice, although you
could have lots of fun with blackouts and sleepwalking and the like if
the PCs were as susceptible as anyone else).  If you're not feeling
charitable, have them find out the HARD way what the ol' spook's
mysterious comments were in reference to.  Maybe stick a scroll (that
must be laboriously deciphered) in with the treasure, describing the
madness demon and perhaps some ways that it can be fought.
=========================================================================
   The party is on some sort of extended vacation, staying in an inn/bar.
A frequent visitor is a tall, dark, suave, charming man dressed in formal
evening wear, accompanied by a different woman every time.  He comes in
every 2nd or 3d night.  He always orders bloody marys and doesn't drink
them. He is quite wealthy and very pleasant.  There is something almost
magnetic about him.  He has fascinating eyes.  (DM should do everything
he can to make it believable that he could be a vampire, despite the
unusual setting (city)).
   Either he charms (charm gaze) a female party member and takes her
away, or a beautiful dancer comes in looking for her missing sister, who
was last seen coming to this bar with the tall,dark gentleman.  She tries
to convince a party member to help her look for her sister being
seductive about it. Both are eventually charmed by the Gentleman.  In any
case, make a party member disappear into this Gentleman's lair.
   He has a gothic style house in a nice part of town.  There is nothing
obviously amiss here.  If the party asks around, this guy is a pillar of
society, a kind, philanthropic fellow, well respected by his peers.  He
runs a magic shoppe.  He is a mid-level wizard with a head for business,
who gave up adventuring to start a business.
   His house looks just like a vampires house might look (black velvet
curtains, etc).  He has a private sanctuary inn his basement, the only
entrance to which is a rune-encrusted door (trapped or enchanted in any
way appropriate to the party).  He supposedly has a chapel down there,
but really has a large complex, where various vampiric rituals, and all-
night parties take place.  All of the missing people have been charmed
into believing that they have been turned into slave vampires.  They will
aid their master if at all possible.
   The party must break in and forcibly take their companion away from
this place.  Again, make the evidence somewhat contradictory whether the
Gentleman is a vampire or not.  Most evidence should say yes, but make
some things contradict this.
   The gentleman has a cursed ring of the vampire, a powerful evil
artifact which makes him believe he is a vampire and gives him many of
the powers of a vampire, as well as some of the drawbacks.  Make him
dislike things that cause a vampire harm, but don't make it obvious
whether is works.  Make him have a reflection, but have a dead vampire
victim show up.  Etc.  At the end, have the party realize that he is not
a vampire at all but rather is a cursed fellow with an intrinsically good
nature.
=========================================================================
   The magic energies (derived from outer space :-)) are dwindling,
slowly but surely.  At this time only the most advanced magicians have
noticed that their most powerful spells are beginning to fail more and
more frequently.
   My explanation is that there is three kinds of magic in the world:
   1) White magic: creative magic, healing, alteration. The white-
magicians are generally the good guys, mostly elves, priests (Gods of
Light) and fairies.
   2) Black Magic: Necromatics, destructive magic, summoning. The black-
magicians are generally the bad guys, mostly humans, black-elves, trolls
and the demons & devils.
   3) The Old Magic: The magic that rules it all; but now almost a
forgotten art, only used by the extinct race of Wizards (yes, wizards are
a distinct race in my world) and the dragons.
   Unfortunately the magic energies are only dwindling for the white-
magicians, since the black-magicians derive their power from the negative
dimension and have opened the gate, so that negative energies flow freely
into this dimension blocking the white-magic.
   The objective is to close the gate, before even the simplest white-
magic is rendered useless and impotent. This cannot be done with the use
of white-magic, but only with the use of the Old-Magic (use of black-
magic will only worsen the situation).
   The problem is to find someone or something that have access to the
Old-Magic and is sufficiently skilled in this art, to reverse the
situation. (this is what the players must think is the objective for them
or initially be let to believe).
   The real problem is that the division between black- and white-magic
is artificial, and will always lead to this problem sooner or later, and
only the Old-magic can prevail (since the white- and black-magic is
derived from the Old-magic, but the separation will corrupt both
branches).  So the players are to be the prophets of the new world order
of magic (or front-runners), after being taught the basics of this by the
only Wizard left on the planet (unless they destroy him in their
folly!!!).  But to find the information that there is such a creature
alive should be very difficult and only referenced by vague hints in old
legends etc.
   My suggestion for the Wizard is that the group can find (after lengthy
research) the place he is rumored to live (e.g. inside a volcano).  And
when they arrive he is there, but frozen inside a huge iceblock, by a
pair of Ice-Dragons that he once forced to humiliate themselves to assist
him, and this is their revenge.  Once every 100 year they let him free
for a day to scorn him, and then deep-freeze him again.  And they will
not take it lightly if the players are to take away their sweet revenge.

=========================================================================
   In my experience, PCs will guard a hundred caravans before it occurs
to them that trading on their own account could be more fun and
lucrative. Part of this is I guess a lack of interest in the "tie-downs"
that trading could imply and in the boring detail of buying and selling.
There are however some good advantages.  It encourages a sense of group
identity - all partners of Fast and Risky Quality Merchant Co. - and can
have some great "plot lines".  It also changes the world outlook when
strangers are first thought of as "Hey CUSTOMERS!" rather then "Arm up,
enemy approaching".  If you ever need to lure your players in a
particular direction then a rumour of profit should be easy to manage.
   PCs can be tempted into the business a bit at a time. For example:  At
conclusion of other business a friendly tribesman notes "Your people make
good iron.  If you are back this way, bring us one of your fine steel
blades and I'll trade two snow leopard skins for it".  $$$$ in characters
eyes! The trick is to avoid the boring bits.
   1) Give them good NPC warehouse men etc that they really can trust
except perhaps once, later rather than sooner, for a plot.  If they feel
they can safely leave a load in trusted hands for a fling then so much
the better.
   2) Have NPC's offer to retail so they are doing the wholesale transit
stuff and dont get lost in selling detail.  "Hey, I'll take all of this
stuff you can get here at xxxx - leave you free to get another load
moving eh?".  Failing that declare, "after 2 hours you are sold out for
xxxx reward".  Forget detailing trading except for casual encounters with
a train.
   3) Forget the unwieldy caravan bit - encourage them into the small
mule train style.  They'll have more fun.  "Yup, de mules certainly de
way.  You see dat caravan train - takes 2 month to move dat round de Gap.
Sheez dat costs!  I ken move dis stuff over Hawk Pass on mules in meebe
tree weeks on a good run."
   4) Emphasize the exploratory opening up of new country rather then the
big-haul routes.  If they start into going back and forth on the same
lucrative route too often, send in a big merchant with a massive caravan
to drop the prices.  They'll thank you for it in terms of game interest.

Some typical sorts of plots.
   -Guarding the goods train. They'll really do it in earnest.
   -Spying on the side under their legit cover.
   -Involvement in local politics
   -Exploration
   -Building of fortified outposts and defense thereof
   -Very dangerous goods!  (i.e. magic)
   -Recovery of stolen goods
   -Dealing with a protection racket
   -High risk winter route to relieve a starving outpost.

   One potential problem is the possibilty of too much coin.  Relax.
Early in their career get them used to the idea that high profits come
from real high risks and sometimes its better alive poor then rich and
dead.  ("You are surrounded by 20 young mounted warrior louts looking for
trouble.  They request 'presents' with broad grins.  All are bow armed
(and they've been training since 3 years old)".  Remember that elaborate
trading has high overheads in paying NPCs etc.  If there is somehow got a
money excess then introduce credit offered by bankers - on risky routes
they will sooner or later lose a train bought on borrowed money and the
overheads will put them on the back foot!
========================================================================
   A powerful wizard and his apprentice (also powerful) are after an
artifact which is carefully guarded (by various traps, magics, etc) in a
labyrinth.  Put in there years ago by various leaders and since
forgotten.  They cannot think of a brute force way to get it, but they
are clever enough to have figured out some loopholes which will allow a
low-level bunch of adventurers with various characteristics (tailor to
your players, one obstacle per player or combination of players) to get
in safely and escape with the artifact.
   The wizard cooks up a long term plan (perhaps he is an elf) to obtain
such a party of adventurers.  This plan is subtle and tricky as that is
the style of this wizard (he likes to manipulate and deceive people, like
a game).  He has his apprentice disguise himself as an old
storyteller/bard who takes a liking to a young pc or npc and tells
stories of the PC/NPC's grandfather who stopped a great evil by
sacrificing himself, sealing the evil and himself into a labyrinth (yes
THE labyrinth).  The grandfather was lost with his family sword and more
importly an amulet which signified the family's power and destiny as
heroes of the realm.  Various stories of the grandfather, sword, and
amulet should convince the PC/NPC to go after this stuff.
   The storyteller also tells of the PC/NPC's family talent for dowsing,
and helps him cut a dowsing rod and casts various covert magics to make
the character believe he has such power.  Eventually he replaces the
dowsing rod with an identical duplicate which is set up to find the other
characters who are needed to get the artifact back (yes, the party).  The
character recruits or finds the party and they go and get the amulet
back.
   The wizard and apprentice appear at the exit from the labyrinth and
reveal the hoax (part of the fun), demanding the amulet.  The apprentice
is either given or takes the amulet for the wizard, then gets a greedy
look in his eyes and makes to put it on.  The wizard vaporizes the
apprentice and takes the amulet.
   You might want to put some sort of treasure in this labyrinth so the
party won't be too pissed that they have been deceived.
   The wizard invites the characters to join in his "games" (see below).
If they decline, he does various things to convince them to comply.  If
that fails, he cooks up another complicated deception to get them to join
in.  He will not force them to join, unless he feels that he has
sufficiently deceived them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The party is asked to go on a quest by an older man, a merchant, to
save his daughter's life.  She has the dreaded Indigo Flu, usually fatal.
The only known cure is to make a medicine out of the Caiman stone, an odd
fruit that grows out of a mineral/plant hybrid only in the most obscure
places.  The party is referred to the sage who told the merchant of this
cure, for more info. The sage is of course an agent of the Wizard of the
previous segment.
   He cooks up a quest designed to bring the party eventually to a spot
at which the wizard has planted a "Caiman Bush".  The Caiman stone and
the Indigo flu are complete fiction.  The party will not find anybody
else who knows about these even if they ask around.  The Caiman Bush is
an elaborate magic item, which will teleport the party into the Wizard's
lair.  The wizard will then inform them that the only exit from his lair
is to win the game.
   The game is versus another party which has been in suspended animation
waiting for opponents.  (Losers of the game are suspended and continue to
play until they win, whereupon they are released).  Make the game
whatever you wish.
   You should maybe allow the party to acquire some limited magic items
from the game, so they won't be quite so pissed to have been manipulated.
=========================================================================
   Riddle-maps (idea based on "song-maps" that the old time Maori people
used to describe journeys).
   Basically sage-type person translates a song-map that someone earlier
had written down in its original form.  Lots of scope for errors.  It's a
translation so no need for poetry.  Sage identifies one point in song as
being nearby and wants the map followed.  Fit into your world.  The
characters can only "see" what you describe so very careful descriptive
work is necessary but red herrings can be fun.

An example of full riddle map.
   "here the VALATAS people live above the halls the congress of tide and
land, thence two noon suns cross your face and take you to the silver
path.  Up the path you onward go past three cold threads in summer still,
then into the shadows of RAMATIS realm till the path is crossed at the
weeping rock.  Shortly the path splits at last, so turn your face and
walk two sunsets till RAMATIS greets with open arms again. The laughing
braid just in the shades, leads high to towers of earth, and there above
the last falling tears, find the gates of night.  No moon to light the
halls of night but ochre stars will mark a path to those who walk in
here.  Pity you who have no meat to sacrifice to the Old Ones hidden
within.  Once met and your offering received dash for life to the halls
of teeth.  Beyond there lies the ribbon of red, rushing fast to meet the
sun again, then bounding down past flaxen steps, to greet the ghost in
its bed of gold."

Translation:
   Capitalized bits are phonetic translation of unknown words.  The sage
has identified VALATAS so begin here.

The party walks towards the noon sun for 2 days and finds...
   GM: "Towards end of second day you climb to top of ridge and look down
on large river valley with the river glistening in the sun."

   Following it upriver past three side-creeks that would wet you even in
summer you get to woods.  RAMATIS is the old people's God of forests but
the PC's or sage wouldn't know this.  They should easily guess though
when you announce forest in the way.  The river hits a gorge and a
crossing is forced where a waterfall comes down a cliff face. After that
the river divides at two big tributaries and you take the west one for
two days.  Should encounter woods again...however, the puzzle can be
sharpened by woods that are no longer present (keep talking about NEW
building in the area - ruins of a saw mill ??? etc).  A quick flowing
tributary is traced up into the mountains and above the top waterfall is
a cave mouth.  A path through the cave is marked by ochre crosses on the
floor but it is also the lair of monster worms that fall on any meat.
The travellers of old would carry a sheep up and run like hell for the
cave of stalagmites (which block the worm) while it is devoured.  Hope
the PC have something ready...torch light will shortly show an
underground river flowing the other way (no more ochre) which will lead
to high mountain basin.  Geologically an inlier of gold-bearing basement
capped by limestone.  Problem - it exits over a sheer bluff and the rope
ladder has long since rotted away.  The creek joins a larger creek with
the disconcerting habit of disappearing an hour or two after rain (the
"ghost") leaving a dry bed.  And yes, this is based on real place in NZ.
The creeks are gold-bearing if PC ready to dig for it the hard way.
Remnants of digging all over the show.

You get the general idea.  Quite a bit of work and you can lead
characters by the nose through it if so inclined.  Mis-translations can
also help.
=========================================================================
   Every ten years, the Mages' Guild holds a contest.  The prize of the
contest should be left fairly vague, unless one of your PC's is a high-
ranking member of the Guild...I usually use some statement about
"material considerations...well, it's politics mostly..."  However, since
Guild mages tend to be not particularly active types, the contest is
structured as follows:  each mage hires a group of adventurers (here's
where the PC's come in), who then compete for the prize in a maze set up
and run by the Guild.  The party should be hired by a mage, who tells
them basically the information above, plus the number of other groups
competing (I usually use four groups total, since in my maze they tend to
meet up at the end for a final battle, and dealing with more NPC's than
that would get hellish).  The mage gives each PC a magical "token";
basically just a little one-use magic item.  The tokens can have effects
like Levitate (for a duration), Light (ditto), Invisibility (as the
spell); just go through the PH and pick out spells to use.  Make up a
maze to put the party though, and don't forget that several other groups
are doing this at the same time!  The way I run it is that I have a map
of a maze, with four relatively distinct paths to a final room.  They do
cross over, but not very often.  Each has several large empty rooms on
the map, and some marked spots in the corridors.  Then I have a list of
rooms to use, and corridor tricks, and I just insert whichever ones I
feel like when they come to a room or a corridor spot.  The four groups
race through the maze, and the objective is to find a large flashing gem.
I usually set it up so that when the party reaches the last room (where
the gem is), most of the other groups arrive at the same time.  If the
party tries to hang back and let them fight it out, I have some of the
NPC's start going for the gem.  Remember that this was set up by a Mages'
Guild, so you can put in almost anything you want...some examples of
rooms I use are:
   1) The room has a chasm cutting it in two.  There is another door on
the far side, and a bridge across the chasm.  (The chasm is actually an
illusion, but falling in will take the PC out of the contest)  On the
bridge, there are two "knights".  These are merely animated suits of
armor, and they have orders to prevent anyone from crossing the chasm.
They will react predictably to actions by the PC's, and so can be lured
into traps; for example, a thief tries to climb across, one of the
knights moves to block him, the party tosses oil onto the bridge where
the knight would stand, then the thief goes back.  The knight walks back
and slips in the oil.  Make the bridge very narrow and no handrails.
   2) Another room with a chasm, but this one has a maze of invisible
paths crossing it.  The party would have to move very slowly, feeling
their way along and probably mapping the maze as well.  Therefore, you
put a monster (I usually use a nonafel, or cat-o'-nine-tails, from the
Fiend Folio, or else something called an amorph hopper which I made up)
on the bridges to mess them up.  Let the monster leap infallibly from one
spot to another (it knows the maze perfectly), or else let it fly.
   3) A circular room with a pillar in the center.  As soon as one person
enters the room, tell them that they see the door slam behind them and
the room begins to spin.  They are plastered against the outer wall by
the centrifugal force, and are slowly being crushed.  Then send them out
of the room, and tell the other players that they see the guy enter the
room, and then throw himself against the outer wall.  It's an illusion,
of course, and the other players can do whatever they want, but whatever
they do, the trapped character will interpret it as something that would
be happening, or else just something weird happens and he can't figure
out why.  For example: they tried slapping the "trapped" character across
the face.  He felt the blow, but had no idea where it came from.
However, there's a catch:  the crushing is real.  After a little while,
ribs begin cracking...the idea is to try to get the "trapped" character
to disbelieve his surroundings.
=========================================================================
   The PC's have been meandering around differant continents, and they
wind up at this town.  The people of this town are very suppressed, and
do not like strangers.  It seems as though the strangers they have dealt
with in the past are pretty dangerous.
   There is however a thriving community in this town...centered around a
magic users guild.  I admit, a very rare thing indeed.
   As the PC's begin to find out things about this town, they find out
some of the following things:
   1) A powerful MU "owns the town" whether by money or power nobody
knows.
   2) The town government is set up similar to a company:  mayor at the
top, and vice presidents below him each in charge of some community
welfare.  This group of people votes on decisions concerning law,
including trials.
   3) There are one or two members from "the guild" on the council.
   4) Some others of the council are suspected of being influenced to
abstain or cast a certain vote.
   5) Every three months people with handicaps, the aged, and the dying
are removed from this town.
   6) The town is located at the base of a cliff against the sea.  The
only way to the top is a dangerous road with several hairpin turns.
   7) Criminals are put to work mining a roadway through the cliff wall
up to the surface above.
   8) The rocks from the mining are quarried in blocks and are valued in
some lands for building.  The rock is very hard, and has a uniform black
color.
   If the party tries to find out what happens to those who get taken
away,  they will find they are taken to a dead volcano, with a large
valley inside.  This valley does not go through seasons, and the trees
are fruit trees, which always bear fruit.  There is a portal into this
valley.  The portal of mourning.  It opens up every three months on the
soltice dates.  Can you guess what time of day?  At sunrise.  Written on
the archway of the portal is the purpose of the portal, valley, and since
it is old and worn, when the portal was dicovered thirty years ago there
was a loss of translation of the portal of "The Morning."
   There is an evening portal too.  But that one is the entrance to an
old abandoned dwarven kingdom.  It opens up every night.  Each night,
undead skeletons emerge with two tasks.  Gather fruit.  Look for
newcomers, and "welcome" them to shelter.  Skeltons will try to capture
anyone alive with nets.
   Inevitably the PC's will want to go dungeoning and kill off hoards of
skeltons, and free lots of supressed people.  Insert your own dungeon in
this part or use a prefab.
   Eventually, they will meet the lich in the dungeon.  He will ask
several questions about why they killed the skeletons.  Now the poor
people will starve... and so on and so forth.  It will be increasingly
aware that the lich is a good lich.   The lich became a lich to forever
take care of the orchard.
   It turns out there is another lich.  The Good lich is in fear of the
Bad one, who happens to live in the town... heading the MU guild.  The
guild is a structure in which the Lich collects power, items, spells...it
is great if the party has an MU who joined the guild without knowing.
The guild is structured like a membership thing.  Access to libraries is
based on level of membership.  Level of membership changes based on
donations of magic items, artifacts, spells and of course money.
   The possibilities branch out from there... But the deal is to free the
good lich from the wrath of the bad.  They could...
   1) Infiltrate the guild to a level at which it will topple.
   2) Kill the bad lich.
   3) Ignore the Deal.
   4) Rally the town.
   5) Retrieve the good liches talisman from the bad one's possesion.
   Any option is bound to piss someone off.  Good or bad lich, or the 40
or so MU's who have invested their life's savings into the guild.  But
think of all those magic items that must be in there.
=========================================================================
Part 1:
   Chief honcho feeling old, needs to test suitability of daughter as
heir.  A crafty sage NPC called to help.
   Sage's plan:  A honcho's man will pretend to turn traitor and with
PC's will kidnap daughter.  (Big deal - everyone is cooperating).  They
will tell daughter she is to write note saying father to come alone with
ransom.  He will be bumped off by ambush and they will see daughter
confirmed as heir but she will take orders from rival evil honcho.  They
have permission to scare her with anything short of real torture.  She
passes test if she refuses to write or finds a way to warn, or manages an
escape.  A largish group is hired as daughter normally well protected and
PC will really be acting as a guard and protect her whatever her
choices...Pretty boring easy money for players huh since all set up?

Catch:
   The man chosen to play traitor really is a traitor in pay of uncle.
The opportunity to dispose of daughter and become heir is seized.  The
traitor will suggest a cave in isolated area (which just happens to be
moderately fortifiable - not by design; he just likes the isolation) as
place for the hold-out and the father (anxious to be fully informed)
agrees.  PCs may have a better idea but unlikely they will be in a place
unknown to the traitor or father.  Traitor is a coward and won't attempt
on the life of the girl himself but will use any excuse to leave PCs with
girl. Uncle will bring large force to bear on the PCs to wipe her out.
(and them).  Traitor to blame the PCs.

The daughter:
   Really a good choice.  Will not at first agree but will grovel and
pretend submission.  Will write note but encoded to warn.  If no other
opportunity has arisen, the traitor will say he will take note.  If the
players later tell her its a setup (when trouble begins), she will
demonstrate fine combat skills.

Baddies:
   Whatever number to test your PCs.  Will (treacherously) offer free
passage if they will hand over girl.  (PC's may think the daughter
worthless and be tempted to hand her over - mine were!  If they do, they
will not be allowed to leave alive since they are to be blamed with it.
Dead men tell no tales.  Fortunately mine remembered orders to protect no
matter what and girl will reveal the actual contents of her note when she
realises the PC are on her side).  The negotiation delay will give some
time for setting up defences if it occurs to players to hedge.  Too bad
if they don't.
   If the PCs can hold out 2 days, a concerned father will arrive with
relieving force.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2:
   [This was an extension as players grumbled about tiny pay (it was
supposed to be an easy job) and here the sage helps.] I made an earlier
post on the net frp conference on moral dilemmas and here is the detail.

   In reward for services, a sage offers this little test to a group of
PCs.  This is a variation of the famous Prisoner Dilemma based on an
essay by Douglas Hofstadter in Metamagical Themas.  This will work best
with a group that are really involved with their characters and have
played them for some time.
   Players given a counter which is red on one side, black on the other.
They are to hand it secretly to the sage either red side up or black side
up. They will be rewarded according to how all play.

If a PC returns the piece BLACK side up he/she gets:
   For every other player turning in a RED side: A Big reward.
   For every other player turning in a BLACK side: Nothing or very small

If a PC returns the piece RED side up he/she gets:
   For every other player turning in a RED side: A moderate reward
   For every other player turning in a BLACK side: Only a small reward

   It is important the player really understand the reward system before
they make the choice. It is also very important that they can't discuss
with each other what they will do and the returns are made in secret.
When I did it, I had the sage claiming (quite wrongly) he could magically
increase basic attributes and the matrix was:

BLACK choice:
   For every RED piece: Attribute of choice increased by one unit.
   For every BLACK piece: nothing.

RED choice:
   For every RED piece: 50s in money
   For every BLACK piece: 5s in money

   The advantage of offering an attribute change, is that to the players
(more than the PCs) it was a very real temptation to offer BLACK.  Of
course, if they all chose black, nobody would get anything.  If only one
chose red, that player would be fairly annoyed while the rest get one
attribute bumped up.  If you were the only player to choose black, then
you sit very pretty...the details of this dilemma are well discussed by
Hofstadter.  He tried it for real money on his friends, here's your
chance to do the same.  For once, the game is as interesting if the
player is trying to choose for a PC or doing it for him/herself.
   Of course, all hell breaks loose when the sage reveals he is lying and
just gives each a little more than if all had chosen red.....
   The GM should decide what reward matrix the game balance can handle
and whether the sage is honest, but do recommend the attribute lift as
bait.
=========================================================================
   One obvious device for side-line action is the good old vendetta, or
Even Orcs Have Mothers.  Sooner or later, (sooner usually) PC's will by
their actions have ruined someones plans, killed someone favourite
son/uncle/mother/etc and be due for a spot of revenge.  This brings that
most dangerous of monsters up against the PCs - another thinking human.
If the GM looks at the world from the Offended One's point of view, lots
of ways for to get even should suggest itself but here are few ideas.
Toss them into the game at the same time as other action -  the vendetta
may become the main gaming focus but it shouldnt start that way.

The hired thugs:
   Predictable, common but not a bad opening shot anyway to start the
players going. Chances are this will tell the Offended One (OO) that it
wasn't luck and these guys are good, while telling the PCs that life
isn't that simple.

The Trap:
   Can be variation of above but much more creative ways around.  How
about a desirable NPC that spends some time winning the PC's confidence
(helping out on a couple of expeditions say?) before some suitably
creative putting the boot in? (from the unsubtle knife in back through
poison to "inadvertantly" leaving the wrong door open).
   Using their greed to send them against a strongly defended position
with a totally false plan about a supposed way in? (This got my players
past thinking of the vendetta as an sideline nuisance. They were mean and
cold and looking for blood when they returned).
   Or how about when the player are off to visit an unfamiliar culture,
making sure they get stunningly wrong information on cultural
sensitivities.  (I havent play-tested this one, but I imagine could be
very good in a light-hearted game)
   My favourite is close to above.  On an expedition to tribesmen, a
functionary they hadn't much noticed offers them an ornate tribe weapon.
He/she tells them this is could be the key to getting close to the chief.
Tell any barbarian that they can talk to, that they got it by
"Melstilatuk" from a barbarian chief.  He/she further explains that
melstilatuk (use your own languages) is a ceremonial battle and winning
against a chief accords them high status.  In fact the functionary is the
in employ of OO and will quickly vanish.  The weapon was obtained from
the father of current chief in a particularly cowardly ambush that the
tribesmen know about.  If the PCs are curious about the word, a non-
tribal linguist can only translate it as "raven work".  A tribal linguist
if they even bother to find one, would them that melstilatuk is a
colloquial abusive term for corpse-robbing - regarded VERY badly by
tribesman.  The weapon will be instantly recognised by the close
tribesmen to the chief and effect of the characters proudly reciting
their claim can be imagined.

The Frame up:
   Often PCs leave themselves very wide open to being framed and dealt to
wrongly by the law.  This should make it a good option for the OO.  The
trick to playing this so your PCs have a chance is to very thoroughly
think out how the OO sets it up - exactly who is talked to, bribed,
where, who could see it.  PC's will have to pursue what really happened
and they need good detail.  I failed at this on first attempt really but
made up for it belately working in a lot of detail.
   The lying witness or false complaint.  This is the simplist by far if
a bit obvious.  Remember that if all or part of the PC party are free to
investigate then the OO is likely to take measures to protect the
implicated.  My PCs actually utilised this.  They figured the witness
would be guarded so looked out for the guards and followed them (and a
few false trails as well) to locate the OO.
   Doubles.  Illusion magic to make the others look like the PC in a
witnessed crime?  I haven't actually tried it but sounds good.
   Here's a complex one that the players may tumble at any stage but will
land them in serious trouble if they don't.  Baddie in employ of OO poses
to players as a rich jeweller from within a city.  He meets them at a
location outside the city and describes some imaginary double-dealing in
the trade.  The upshot is that he thinks a rival has wrinkled him out of
a distinctive ruby necklace.  His mission for the PC is to probe or watch
a house in the outskirts to see if any sign.  He tells them that the
necklace has a vague enchantment (improve looks, raise charisma that kind
of thing) and could be picked up by detect magic abilities.  Small reward
for successful location.  Big reward if they can get it.  He tells them
he doesn't want them anywhere near his city shop.  They pass a message to
him via person in local pub in writing.  It mustn't mention the goods,
just say party of extra people needed if they can't get it, else tell him
to come alone to a meeting point if they have managed it all themselves.
   The house is the real jeweller's house and the necklace is not heavily
protected as the rubies are fake (which the jeweller knows) but the magic
isn't (of which he is unaware).  The reward should tempt the PCs to go
for it.  They will then send a note to the appropriate place.  Make sure
they write down what it says.  The note goes of course to the OO who then
murders the real jeweller, places the note on his body, then tips off the
watch on where to find the PCs.  Chances are the PCs have written a
highly incriminating note and in addition will be holding property know
to belong to the jeweller.

Final Vendetta notes:
   If a prolonged vendetta is plaguing the players then a certain amount
of paranoia is liable to set in. You may be accused of inventing ways
around their precautions because they tell you them in advance. If you
are, I hope they string you. I f otherwise, don't get angry - suggest a
play fair system.  They write down their precautions when you warn them
that you need to know.  You write down your attack.  At the moment of
truth, notes are compared and a very enjoyable game can be held BETWEEN
GM and players.  This assumes enough maturity on your players that they
build protection that they reasonably could manage by their skills and
money without going through you.  If so have some fun.  This play really
only applies to the Hired Thug approach - the others shouldnt really be
open to abuse.
=========================================================================
Ashburn Man
   For this adventure a group of younger but promising members of the
Odyssians are invited out for a weekend at the country estate of Sir
Henry Ainsford, one of the older members of the club.  Sir Henry is noted
as a hunter and explorer, but he is getting on in years and spends most
of his time at his estate outside of the town of Ashburn in Kent.
   Sir Henry regularly invites Odyssians out for weekend visits, but this
particular weekend is special, because he believes he has made a
discovery of great scientific importance on the grounds of his estate.
This means that he will make sure that Odyssians of particular interests
will be in his group.  He will invite archaeologists, paleontologists,
physicians, historians and ethnologists in particular, plus an assortment
of others who are interested.  He will also invite his two oldest friends
in the Odyssians, Professor Milton Morrisson of the Language and
Ethnology faculty at Oxford and Admiral Sir Joseph Porter (retired).  All
he tells anyone in advance is that he has made a discovery which may
revolutionize the history and science of human origins.

Ashburn House
   Sir Henry's ancestral manse is a 16th century monstrosity, somewhere
inbetween a manor house and a castle, ornate and over decorated.  It is
located on the edge of the range of hills known as the North Downs.  The
trip from London to Ashburn by train takes around two hours.  When they
arrive in the town Sir Henry will have several carriages waiting to take
them to Ashburn House.
   When they arrive they are greeted by Sir Henry, who excuses himself
and seems rather agitated.  They will then get a short tour of the house,
conducted by the major domo, Burton.  Burton shows them the gun room and
the trophy room (lions and tigers and bears, oh my!), the game room,
several parlors and dining rooms, and eventually he shows each of them to
their bedrooms.  Each of the bedrooms is decorated in a different motif,
reminiscent of different parts of the world. The American Room is
decorated with trophies of caribou, beaver and bears.  The East African
room features lions and giraffes.  The Egyptian room has crocodile and
rhinoceros hide chair covers and the like.  The Indian room has a
beautiful tiger skin rug.  The Amazon room has a giant stuffed anaconda
on the wall.  The Orient Room has elephant tusks and panda fur rugs.
There are many more along the same lines.
   After they've settled in, Burton will call them down for dinner.  At
the meal Sir Henry seems agitated, smokes a number of cigars, and barely
touches his food.  When asked about his discovery he is evasive and tells
everyone to wait until after dinner.  Once the meal is concluded, they
retire to the Smoking Room, where a large, coffin-like box, about 2 by 5
feet is waiting on a table in the middle of the room.  Cigars are handed
out, and Sir Henry launches into a speech to the effect that he has
travelled far and seen many things, but that he has made his greatest
discovery literally in his own back yard.
   He goes on to tell how one of his groundskeepers, a man named James
Dearing, was mowing in a grove of ash trees on a hill behind the house,
when he discovered a series of depressions in the ground, all very
regularly spaced.  He reported them to Sir Henry because he was
suspicious that they might be deadfalls set by poachers.  Sir Henry
investigated, had one of the holes dug up, and in the hole they found --
at this point he opens the box -- a small, manlike skeleton buried in the
fetal position, surrounded by garlands of what appeared to be extremely
well preserved wild flowers.  The skeleton he reveals is in rather good
condition, completely bare, about 4 and a half feet tall.  What makes it
remarkable is that while generally manlike in appearance, it has an
elongated lower jaw, pronounced cranial ridges and elongated upper and
lower canines, all characteristics of great apes, rather than man.
   Everyone crowds around, and Professor Morrison, and possibly others,
declare that it must be a hoax.  Someone is clearly trying to put
something over on Sir Henry, taking the jaw of an ape and the body of a
deformed human child and putting them together.  But on closer
examination it is clear that the jaw fits perfectly with the rest of the
skull, and the skull clearly fits the spine, and all the bone appears to
be of the same age.  Professor Morrison can't be sure, but given the
style of burial and the condition of the bones he believes that they
predate the early Celtic settlement of the British Isles, and if it is
not a hoax, he theorizes that this might be one of the 'Dark Folk', the
aboriginal inhabitants of Britain who were wiped out by the Celts and
survive only in legend.
   As Morrison seems to have become convinced, Sir Henry becomes even
more excited, and explains that there are 7 more burial shafts and that
he intends to excavate them all in the next few days with the help of his
fellow Odyssians. That said, he closes up the box, leads everyone out of
the Smoking Room and locks the door.  At this point some of the guests
are probably tired and retire, and others go to the game room or to the
Library for some recreation.

Night at Ashburn House
   During the night several things will happen.  One of the characters
with a relatively high PSI will happen to peer out of his window late at
night.  Off in the distance he will see a round hill with a grove of grey
ash on the top of it. The ash are swaying in the wind.  Then he notices
that none of the other trees in the garden or beyond seem to be swaying
at all, and he gets the feeling that there's something almost conscious
about the movements of the ash.
   Another character will have a dream during the night.  He will dream
of a procession of thin, regal looking women bearing glowing spheres of
light passing through his room, passing through the door as if it or they
were immaterial, and moving on into the hallway.

In the Morning
   When they awaken in the morning they notice that Professor Morrison
doesn't join them for breakfast.  Then Sir Joseph mentions that he was up
late with Morrison drinking brandy in the library and that when he went
to bed at 2am Morrison was still there reading.  He suggests that
Morrison might want to sleep late.  Sir Henry is a bit non-plussed by
this, but is ready to set out to the wilds of the backyard anyway.
   Burton brings picks, rubbers and shovels after breakfast and everyone
heads out to the burial site.  It is a small clearing in the middle of an
ash grove on top of a hill.  The ashes are of a miniature variety, but
healthy and well established, clearly well cared for.  In the middle of
the clearing is a 6 foot high, very worn menhir surrounded (after some
searching) by eight depressions in the ground, spaced evenly in a circle,
one of them recently filled in.  The digging commences.
   In each of the burial shafts they will find a skeleton similar to the
one already found by Sir Henry.  It is unlikely that anyone will dig in
the shaft which the first skeleton was taken from, but if they do, they
will find the mangled body of Professor Morrison there.
   It will take most of the day to dig out the shafts.  And at noon or so
Burton will bring out tables and campaign chairs for a leisurely lunch at
graveside.
   Professor Morrison never joins them, and as they prepare to head back
to the house, Sir Henry tells Burton to make sure the Professor is
feeling well and have him meet them in the Smoking Room.
   When the grisly trophies are gathered in the Smoking Room, Burton
arrives with the announcement that Professor Morrison is missing, and not
only that, but it is clear that he didn't pack up and leave, because his
clothes are still there and his bed has not been slept in.
   The last place the Professor was seen was in the Library, and a close
inspection of the Library will reveal an open copy of Tacitus on the
floor, some dots of blood around it, and the fact that the tiger skin rug
which is normally there is missing.

What's Going On?
   The grove of ash trees is an ancient holy place.  Each of the eight
largest ash trees contains a powerful guardian spirit which can manifest
as a young woman (as in the dream above) or can possess and animate non-
living flesh (tiger skin rugs, etc).  These Ash Maidens will attempt to
get the skeletons back, or replace them with new sacrifices, like
Professor Morrison.
   If they go and dig out the original burial shaft, they will find
Professor Morrison's body, mauled as if by a tiger, wrapped in the tiger
skin rug from the Library, and garlanded with wild flowers.  It may take
them a while to figure out to do this, so let them stew and be mystified.
   The spirits can only be placated by returning all the skeletons and
maintaining absolute silence about their existence.  In fact, if they go
to re-bury the skeletons they will find that there are now ten holes
instead of eight, eight for the skeletons, one for Professor Morrison and
one for Sir Henry.  The spirits will do all they can to make sure that
hole is filled.
   The powers of the spirits are limited.  They can only operate in
darkness. They cannot travel more than a mile from the grove.  Each
spirit can only animate one thing per night.  Passing through solid
objects is relatively strenuous for them, so they do it as little as
possible.

The Second Night
   Most likely, by the second night they will either be working on or not
have solved the mystery.  That night as they sleep, several things may
happen.
   Most likely one or more of the characters will be awakened by the
sound of pounding and rending as an assortment of elk and gorillas and
the like attempt to break into the Smoking Room.
   Someone, or maybe even two of the characters, will find that the
stuffed anaconda or bearskin rug or boarskin bedspread will come to life
as they are drifting off to sleep and attempt to attack them and drag
them out to the grove.
   The same character who saw the ash swaying the night before will look
out the window at midnight and think that he sees the ash transformed to
women who then move in a procession towards the house.
   Someone who is relatively susceptible to such things will be visited
by two of the Ash Maidens who will attempt to seduce him, take him to the
grove, manipulate his mind and will, essentially enslave him, and then
send him back to the house to get the skeletons and Sir Henry for them.

Can they Save Sir Henry?
   Most likely not.  The only way to save Sir Henry would be to keep the
Ash Maidens and their animated creatures away from him throughout the
second night and then get him away from Ashburn House immediately in the
morning, never to return.  In fact, in that situation the house would
have to be permanently abandonned because the Ash Maidens would keep
looking for sacrifices.
   Alternatively, they could burn down the grove.  This would be sick,
cruel and immoral, but would get rid of the Ash Maidens until saplings
which escaped the burning grew to maturity in several years, at which
point the problem would reemerge.
   Finally, they could offer someone else in sacrifice, but finding a
willing victim is unlikely, and giving an unwilling sacrifice would be
inappropriate.
   Regardless of how they deal with the situation they will face moral
dilemmas which will not be easily resolved, because the Ash Maidens
should really be preserved as an invaluable paranormal resource, and
though their demands of sacrifice are justified by their lights, it will
be hard for reasonable people to go along with them.

Part the first:

[To the tune of Spam Spam Spam....]
Lich lich lich lich lich lich....

Anyway, what's this preocupation with liches? Sounds  like they're a
dime a dozen.  Granted I like playing in lower power campaigns, and I
didn`t read very far into the synopsis book, but, but, ...I guess I'll
just substitute "key personality" or something....


Part the second:

Here's a little synopsis for parties with research-y types:

You find a book, a second copy of a book you have or have seen before,
or can look at.  On reading and/or close examination you find that the
new copy has an extra pasage/paragraph detailing where the famous
hero/ine was burried/trapped. The book can be a history of the land, a
tale of brave deeds etc.  No other copies of the book have this passage,
wise persons who are familiar witht the work can't recall the  passage
in any thing they've read (but maybe someone will kind of confirm the
rumor...).

This can be used to get the characters to travel to different locations
(away from civilization, toward it, etc.).

Once they get there there are a few options (in order of time
comsumption increasing concerning the book):

The tomb/place exists but is uninteresting
The tomb doesn't exist (could take PC's a long time to believe you)
Tomb exists, but people will tell you it doesn't
vice versa (tomb no, people say yes, pc's spend spend spend)
tomb exists but not there (here?)
tomb exists (sorta) but it's a trap by the scribes who confirmed
its existence for you.
and other odd combinations....

Short Summaries
----------------
=========================================================================
   One of the PC's falls in love with a woman who happens to be a
witch...perhaps she is allied with a group working against the PCs?
=========================================================================
   The PCs are sent with an ambassador to another country to protect him
and do his bidding.  There may be some espionage, rescuing, downright
bullying, etc.  Could make a nice medieval special operations background.
=========================================================================
   After a rash of thefts from wizards in the Guild, the PCs are hired to
catch the perpetrators.  They could be other mages, three dozen halfling
thieves, demons, or even time travelers.  PCs need to figure out who
might get hit next, how to catch the criminals, who are they, etc.
=========================================================================
   After a fight where all the PC's seemingly died or are captured, they
wake up to the crack of a whip, as they have been sold into slavery
onboard a galley.  They have no equipment, they have to work to
exhaustion, they get very little food, but if they play well, they might
be able to escape.
=========================================================================
   The Queen's beau (a very handsome knight-errant or something) is
missing and he was last seen in a tavern at the edge of town.  The PC's
are the people who were determined to have useful information, after a
lengthy interview/screening by the Queen's Marshall-General, etc.  They
set out to find him, since it is thought he is in grave danger.
=========================================================================
   The party wakes up around a table with wine goblets near at hand.
They discover that they have forgotten everything they did over the past
two weeks.  Apparently, as they uncover clues, they were hired by someone
to do a job, and when the job was finished the person invited them to
dinner.  Interesting events abound as the party attempts to piece
together the events of the last fortnight...
=========================================================================
   Bonecrusher (an Orc, now a Giant Orc Chieftain) has found the Gauntlet
of Grummsh (an orcish Artifact) and is kicking some serious butt, raising
an orc army and is about to invade the country to, er, root, pape, and
lillage the area (he's powerful, but he's still an orc.)  Of course, the
destruction of this gauntlet is very important to the players.
Bonecrusher could be considered the Guardian of the Gauntlet, and
destroying it *will* bring curses from Grummsh onto the party.
=========================================================================
   Four dragons (one blue and three greens) have banded together to
increase their wealth.  They (gasp) spent it on various magical weapons
and defences and then attacked and took over a port city.  Now they've
removed all laws, taxing everything.  All the good folk have escaped, and
some are running a resistance force.  Of course, there's a catch.
The blue dragon's been possessed by a lower planar being, and is opening
a gate...
=========================================================================
   A young drow got 'left behind' after a raid to the surface.  He is a
mid-level fighter, slightly lower-level magic user.  Maybe give him a few
pet large spiders for some extra challenge.  He could take over a farm
house (or two) with charm spells (maybe even charm a few of the animals).
He could try and trick the party into finding the entrance to the drow
realm for him (or maybe kill some inconvenient big thing).  Anyway, as
there's only one drow, a party of four or five lower level characters
wouldn't really be in too great a danger.
=========================================================================
   In a cave, in an incredibly cold pool of water, is a large round white
stone (about 3 or 4 feet in diameter).  It feels to all the world like
marble, and radiates magic.
   It's actually a white dragon egg.  It stays in stasis, just hours from
hatching, until it's heated up... to just about room temperature.  Then
it hatches.  If your players are like mine, they'll take a big white
magic rock without thinking twice; it should then hatch at exactly the
worst time.  My players made it all the way back to their ship, and put
it in the hold, before it hatched.  Great fun.
=========================================================================
   One of the things I do for comic relief is have the PCs run across a
particular ship full of really stupid sailors.
   They are almost always in dire trouble when the PCs come across them,
like the one time they were out in the middle of the ocean and their
sails were on fire.  The PCs had to put the fire out for them, because
they didn't think of using sea water to put it out themselves.
   The name of the ship is the _Storm_, and the captain ("pilot") looks
and sounds an awful lot like Robert Plant.
   It shouldn't take too much prodding before the PC's start calling it
the "Ship of Fools"....
=========================================================================
"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing"

   A demon (e.g. Cambion demon) has taken the shape of a respected member
of the community (using polymorph self) and, masking his true alignment,
shape and abilities, is slowly spreading death and terror in the city.
The PC's are hired (as special agents by ??) to find the perpetrator and
capture/kill them before it gets even more out of control.  The demon is
able to change shape easily and hence occasionally changes to take the
form of one of its victims to throw off the scent.  Its sole purpose is
to cause disruption and Chaos (or was it brought here by someone for
other reasons and escaped or was turned loose ?).
=========================================================================
"Curse of the Incontinent Dragon"

   The party ventures into a small town after their latest expedition,
only to find that the towsfolk are in an uproar.  The mayor tells the
party about the "cursed beast of darkness" which rises from its burrows
to the north and flies over the hapless village dropping flaming missles
from his bowels.  As the players pass by the mayor's house, they note the
gruesome stench.  Gobs of acid-spitting larvae still snake through the
burnt ruins.  To make a long story short, the witch of the wyrmwoods
which surround the village has cast a curse upon the foul dragon who used
to be a nature loving and solitary beast.  Now, in his incontinence, he
regards the town as his private toilet.  Furthermore, the curse has also
reduced his intelligence by, oh say, 15 points perhaps.  "Aww... duh...
you mean you know ahh... I wasn' a 'spose to poop der... dahhhh!"
=========================================================================
   There's a logging town nearby that, all of a sudden, starts spending
money like there's no tomorrow.  They go from a little frontier town to a
place like <insert your favorite preppie-type suburb here> in a matter of
months.  The players should be "just passing through", and notice this
large change.  They pass a bard that tells of the eighth murder in the
town in a month.
   What's really going on is that someone with tons of money is having
the loggers clear-cut the forest the logging town is near.
Unfortunately, the forest has a guardian (a dragon) that is a bit
fanatical and unscrupulous in his guardianship; to scare the loggers into
ceasing from clear-cutting the forest, he hires some assassin/terrorists
to kill random loggers in the city.  The players' mission, should they
choose to accept it, is to stop this situation from escalating any
further.
=========================================================================
   This adventure is best for a party of low-level fantasy characters.
   A mage has managed to control an Ice Lizard (a la Fiend Folio), and
uses it to his own ends.  In my case, kidnapping a sage.  The trick:  it
can appear to be a white dragon.  Thus, the adventure seems very scary
indeed from the all the dragon rumours surrounding the kidnapping, but
Ice Lizards aren't even pale shadows of real dragons.  So, it's exciting,
but manageable for low power parties.
   Eventually, the party may figure out that it's not a real dragon and
gain confidence to attack it (if they were too cautious).  The final
showdown is between the party, and the low level mage and his pet.  For
extra excitement, add a few minions, some traps in the lair, etc.
   Naturally, the lure doesn't have to be a kidnapped sage, it could be
rumours of dragon raids, a fair maiden kidnapping, or whatever you
please.
=========================================================================
   The party finds a book, a second copy of a book they have or have seen
before, or can look at.  On reading and/or close examination they find
that the new copy has an extra passage/paragraph detailing where the
famous hero/ine was buried/trapped.  The book could be a history of the
land, a tale of brave deeds etc.  No other copies of the book have this
passage, wise persons who are familiar witht the work can't recall the
passage in anything they've read (but maybe someone will partially
confirm the rumor...).
   Once they get there there are a few options (in order of time
consumption increasing concerning the book):
   -The place exists but is uninteresting
   -The place doesn't exist (could take the party a long time to believe you)
   -The place exists, but people tell the party it doesn't
   -The place doesn't exist, but people say it does
   -The place exists but it's somewhere else
   -The place exists, but it's a trap by the scribes who confirmed its
    existence for you.
=========================================================================
   The party is hired to transport scrolls to a temple in the hills, far
from their hometown.  They arrive in town, and discover that some
townsfolk have disappeared.  They meet the high priest, deliver the
goods, and are prepared to leave, when they find the body of the high
priest somewhere in town.
   It seems a small band of doppelgangers have uncovered a lead to a
magic item/relic that is buried beneath the tombs under the temple.  The
scrolls provide information of some sort the doppelgangers need to get to
the item.  The missing people are being used as slaves to dig beneath the
tombs (which of course are full of nasties).
   The final scene should be between the head doppelganger and his
cronies just as the item is unearthed.
   I've kept the details out of the description, because a lot of the
stuff (like what's in the scroll) can be campaign-dependent.  But if the
players are perceptive/paranoid, they might blow this into a full-blown
campaign:  Did their employer know the high priest was a doppelganger?
Is there a conspiracy to get doppelgangers into power in the human world?
=========================================================================
   In a big classy town that the PC's have reason to go to every once in
a while (I have it set in a city near a paladin training center) is an
even classier restaurant called Chez Ralph.  It's about as nice a
restaurant as you could possibly have.  Waiters check on you every minute
or so, there's a string quartet playing in the background, and glasses of
water ("Mineral water, imported from halfway around the world" is what
they tell you, and they're telling the truth) cost around 20 gp.
   Besides being a wonderful place to have players dump some cash, it's
also Soap Opera City.  The bizarrest people show up there, at the same
time the PCs are there - but since nobody wants to make a scene, the
whole feeling is very tense.  Old girlfriends, major enemies, spies,
polymorphed dragons, you name it, end up eating there - and usually with
each other.
   This requires a lot of continuity in the game.  Most games couldn't
support the type of background and tension Chez Ralph requires.  You need
long-term NPCs that the PCs have come to hate - and put them here, where
you just can't DO anything about them!
=========================================================================
"Tower Snatch"

   A mage returns home after 1 year away and finds that someone has taken
over his tower in the city.  He wants it back and hires the PCs to
reclaim it.  He can supply maps etc of what it was like when he owned it
(but someone may have moved "Walls of Stone" and placed whole new trap
areas etc).  The PC's can keep anything in the tower which is not
specifically his (of course he can claim anything interesting and they
won't know) and a cash reward.  No-one knows who has it but he suspects
someone respected in the community, hence the attack must be done fairly
quietly so as not to warn the current possessor (the mage can prove that
he is the owner however, he is not setting them up - unless you want this
to happen).  The tower is appropriately trapped and guarded, mostly with
the expectation of killing the mage who owns it when he tries to return.
The guards and traps are there to kill (not capture) anyone breaking in.
City guards etc will not take sides unless the conflict ends up outside
the tower.
=========================================================================
   This is a non-linear adventure, good as a sideline for whenever the
PC's happen to be home.
   The PC's are based in a large city.  The city is basically composed of
three sectors. Two of which are virtually lawless and the other is
extremely well controlled.  The law portion is extending outward and
slowly taking over the other two sections.
   A faction war is taking place in the city.  There are two opposing
forces at war with each other (it could be a peasant/slave revolt, or a
religious purge, or a supernatural invasion, or whatever.)
   The war expands steadily, more and more groups getting dragged into it
and being forced to choose sides.  An interesting twist would be for 2
groups that 2 different PC's belong be on different sides.  Great chance
for roleplaying here!
   The war could develop while the PCs are away, and upon return they get
the opportunity to jump in.
   Think of it, the politics!  The adventure!  The intrigue!  The danger!
The chance to be hunted by one of the most powerful groups in the
city/county/country/kingdom!
=========================================================================
"Gamma World"

   An item has been stolen from a temple/mage/lord etc, the thieves
trailed to a portal leading to an unknown plane/realm.  The PC's are
hired to follow and retrieve the item and/or scout the realm.  The realm
escaped to is from the Gamma World game.  Several thousand years after an
atomic war, patches of technology still exist.  Most survivors are animal
and/or human mutants and have a mix of equipment.  Laser pistols, bow and
arrows, smart missiles, swords, armalite rifles, battle axes, war robots
etc.  Survivors are TOUGH and many have physical and/or mental mutations,
as the weak ones have already died out.  Several technological
installations still exist, guarded by robots etc.  PCs must trace the item,
find the current owners, retrieve the item and return before radiation
traces in the atmosphere slowly kill them.  (Optionally, the portal is
now set so that it can only be used by someone carrying the stolen item,
hence stopping the PC's escaping or more raiders coming through).
Equipment bought back may or may not work.  PCs with laser pistols,
rocket launchers and mini-tanks are worrying in fantasy worlds.
=========================================================================
   A plot for a Paranoia campaign:
   A Death Leopard Head Honcho decides to run a scam on the First Church
of Christ Computer Programmer.  Her theology is fairly limited: "Jesus H.
Christ" stands for J. HARLEY C., and Harley is the 3rd person in the
Trinity.  Jesus said "Have Fun!", and Harley shows us HOW to have fun.
As the prophet of the Lord, she begins convincing lower Church members of
the truth (her Death Leopard handle is Son of David, which she changes to
Son-U-David for missionary purposes, and which also allows a handy link
to Harley).  The main mission consists of forming a rock group where she
and her lieutenants take on yet more persona as ELL's Angels (Gabr-I-ELL,
Raph-I-ELL, Mike-I-ELL and Ur-I-ELL) and give impromtu concerts to the
Infrareds, inciting all 30 000 of them in the sector to "Have Fun!"  She
proposes a link between the Church and Death Leopard, which shall be
called the First Church of Harley Games Progammer.  It is a vital, yet
little understood (especially by her) part of her thelogy that Jeremiah
was a bullfrog.
   Troubleshooters should be inserted, perhaps as agents for the high
Church officals in Internal Security, who may or may not have varying
degrees of certainty on how heretical all this is.  Of course, if the
Troublesootters are IntSec, they have a good chance of being Church
themselves, and may get caught up in the low clearance revivalist
atmosphere...
=========================================================================
   The party has just cleaned out some ex-mage's compound.  In the
scenario I was working with, the party had found a virgin ring of spell-
storing and some matched jewelry, but just about any similar high-power
magic would be useful as a set-up.
   The party is resting from their endeavors when a well-dressed person
comes to find them at their current quarters.  He is an emissary from a
high-level noble of a nearby country.  He asks if the party is the one
that cleared out the mage's quarters.  If the party denies it, he
produces proof.  After the identification, the emissary asks if they have
the magic item.  He explains that the item belongs to his master, it was
commissioned and paid for.  He demands the item and offers little or no
(DM's choice as necessary to provoke the party) reward.  When the party
refuses the emissary explains that by the laws of the country he comes
from the item belongs to his master and they must return it to him.
   If the party still refuses, the emmisary declares them outlaw
(something most countries ignore) from his country.
   Whenever life is getting boring after that, send an assassin or two or
maybe thieves to steal the desired item after the party.  If the party
tries to go after the noble they will have the difficulty of manuvering
in a country where they are outlaws.  The whole setup provides a good
hook for several other plots and can be used to cause havok wherever the
PC's go.
=========================================================================
   The group has come to a city of which half has been taken over by
orcs.  The humans still control the other half.  This stalemate has
lasted for approximately 2 weeks with occasional border penetrations by
each side into the opposing half (guerilla raids, party loves 'em,
2sp/head!).
   But things have changed for the better/worse.  An army from the north,
in an attempt to make good on the city/kingdom's problems, has sailed
into town.  They wiped out the mercenaries guild (the only opposing
force) and stated that all people were now citizens of the new empire and
they would be rid of the orc menace within two weeks.  Everyone has been
drafted into the militia.  What is really bizarre about the army is that
it consists of all sorts of races (human, elf, 1/2 elf, etc), all speak a
common tongue, they are VERY well organized yet are individuals.
(Everyone has personal weapons, armor, etc.)
   The party can decide what to do.  They may not like the idea of being
drafted into the militia to be used as fodder (for an empire they don't
belong to) to rid the town (that they are only visiting) of the menace.
However, it WILL provide for some good roleplaying trying to explain to
the new invaders why the group should (or rather wants) to remain
together.
   The plus is that after the orcs are gone, the militia wil be disbanded
(or so the invaders say) and the members will be free to go on their way
as citizens of the new empire (more lands to visit).  The other bonus is
that the party may be able to get ahold of a little of the recaptured
territory.
=========================================================================
"Acquainted With the Night"

   A group of players *start* by discovering that one of their friends
has been bitten by a vampire.  They follow through the entire process,
possibly killing their friend once he/she has risen again, probably
hunting down the vampire that bit their friend.  Happy ending.
   Then the vampire community seeks retribution.  Yes, it was clumsy of
the vampire to get caught, but it's not the place of the herd to exact
justice on the vampires.  The complexity of this scenario depends upon
how you imagine the entire supernatural community.
   One possible idea is that vampires -- the cool manipulative Undead --
just don't exist.  Vampires are mindless creatures which reek of clotted
blood and which fixate on their families because those are the strongest
memories left.  A vampire is what happens to someone who dies of a ghoul-
bite.  (Doesn't happen often because ghouls don't usually bite live
people.  NOTE:  these are obviously not _Vampire: The Masquerade_
ghouls.) The image of the vampire is the result of a plot between the
ghouls and the werewolves: they wanted a patently false supernatural
image that would distract attention from themselves.  In this case, the
PCs are under attack because they have a sample vampire to look at and
modern science may discover the connection.
   If you're running _Vampire: The Masquerade_, then the PCs are
initiated by a Sire for their own protection.  The Sire has some long-
standing grievance against the Sire of the clumsy vampire, or has some
ideological conflict with those who would kill the PCs.
=========================================================================
"Dandelion Party"

   North America is balkanized, split into twelve smaller countries, most
of which call themselves the United States of America (except for two
which call themselves Canada and one Quebec).  Teleporting aliens (the
Dandelions) have discovered Earth, which means that the other races of
the interstellar Confederation have found us.
   All trade agreements are tentative and depend upon Earth's acceptance
into the Confederation.  We are engaging in an exchange of art objects
(yeah, I know I stole this from _Doorways In The Sand_), and Earth seems
to have lost one of the alien artifacts.  [When I ran this, it was a
"pure" AI they lost; a wirehead had accidentally jacked it into the world
network.  Choice of artifact depends upon how the artifact was lost (by
accident or not) and who is after it.]
   Each country wants to be the one to find it.  [Country of choice],
which had the artifact when it disappeared, doesn't want the news to get
out, though all the security services know about it.  A subgroup of
carnivorous aliens don't want the humans to find it.
   Alien motivation:  Humans may make amusing game or food animals, but
it's not practical to ship them across interstellar space.  However, if
humans fail to make it into the Confederation, the aliens can bid on
copyright to human DNA, producing clones for whatever purposes they want.
[Intelligent species own their own copyrights.]  Aliens may also have
internecine struggles.
   The characters could be innocent bystanders, diplomats, detectives,
police officers, spies for the L-5 colonies, ninjas, yakuza...
=========================================================================
"Not All Be Changed"

   Superheroes seem to form their own communities, their own strata in
society.  Given that some of these people have the power of a nuclear
bomb, it's understandable that certain espionage, police, and security
agencies would want a mole in the superhero community.
   The easiest types of supers for a non-super agent type to simulate are
martial artist-gadgeteers and armoured-suit guys.  (Actually, the agency
may not have the budget for a *really good* armoured suit; I ran it with
a martial-artist gadgeteer as the mole.)  And having a secret ID is a
good excuse for wandering off at odd times (and making reports to
superiors).
   The problem begins when the mole goes native.  He forgets about making
reports, he forgets about his loyalties, he's just caught up in the
entire experience of being one of the Good Guys and thumping the Mauve
Marauder.  He ignores a recall order, so the Agency sends people in to
collect him.
   The PC's can be the agents sent to collect the mole, or they can be
other supers, who are helping to defend the mole without knowing quite
what's going on.
   If you need to make things more confusing, there's the fact that he's
been recalled because his ID has become known to *other* Agencies, and
they want to capture him (in the guise of a supervillain, perhaps) and
wring his brains about that little escapade in Bangkok four years ago, or
the defection of Gyorgi Dimitrov, or whatever suits your political
inclinations.
=========================================================================
For a mostly non-human party:
   The party is approached by an elf.  He explains the following
situation:
   His nephew (niece, whatever) was visiting some relatives a ways away,
and during the travel home was "invited" to stay with a human lord.  The
lord sent a message that he wanted to arrange a "lease" of some territory
for his brother to hold for (say) 30 years or so.  The elves are very
aware that such "leases" nearly always end up being permanent.  They wish
to secure the return of their relative, without allowing the lease.  By
their standards the health of their relative is more important than the
relatively small lease, but they cannot act directly as the lord is on
the other side of a neighboring humano-centric country.  An elven force
large enough to take the relative back would have to fight its way there
and break long-standing peace treaties and probably start a war.  So they
want someone to act in stealth for them, they cannot provide any security
outside their own country.  The party's job, should they accept it, is to
find the relative, break it free and return to the elven territory...
without causing an inter-racial incident in the process.
   The lord's holding should be strong enough that a direct attack by the
PC's is suicide.  Be prepared to have the party try several different
methods.
   Some twists possible:  The elf is a mage, but has lost/used up all his
spells and the lord has his spell-book hidden.  The elf is drugged and
won't cooperate.  The elf is forced by a magical curse to stay near the
lord's castle.  A member of the elf's retinue is a traitor and tries to
interfere with the party in non-obvious ways..... (traitor is a
polymorphed human?)
=========================================================================
"Make Judgement by Their Rules"

   A starship receives a distress signal from a cold-sleep colony ship
launched X years before, to an unexplored section of space.  When they
arrive, they discover that the entire colony ship is under the death
sentence (or has already been killed) because a native killed one of the
colony ship's scouts.  The reason was that the scout violated <apparently
untranslatable concept>.  You may up the stakes by leaving the entire
colony ship, still in cold sleep, in orbit, and the captain apparently
committed suicide.  The scenario is a mystery:  why do *we* get punished
for *them* killing us?  *Why* did they kill us?
   The crew of the starship is soon under the same death penalty.
Evidence shows that the scout had a slight xenophobia--("Well within
bounds, though--he was a scout, after all.")  The aliens happen to be
horned hominids, vaguely Satanic looking.  Further examination shows that
the scout also had a strongly religious background.
   Eventually, peculiarities in the alien culture are explained when it's
discovered that they are telepathic in some ways, and that <concept> is
*Privacy*.  Or maybe *Aggravated Mental Assault*.  The scout didn't have
the decency to keep his/her emotions under control, the alien picked them
up and broadcast them back, and *voila* positive feedback cycle wherein
the alien was tougher than the human, and won the fight.
   This scenario depends upon a universe where telepathy is not
impossible but is also not present among any of the players and probably
not common or reliable in player space.  I've never run it because I
haven't had any brilliant thoughts about a society created by
graminivorous telepaths.
=========================================================================
"Sword Of Kadorn"

   An introductory fantasy adventure.  Players are a group of village
adolescents who have discovered a Sword of Power.  The local lord
responsibly decides that it should be sent to the capital, where they
have mages who would understand such a thing, and since the PC's are not
needed between spring shearing and harvest, the lord sends them with an
advisor (village hedge-wizard, old man-at-arms, family retainer,
whatever).  The sword has chosen one of the PCs as its carrier.
   Beyond the simple journey to the capital is the fact that the sword
has its own agenda.  Possibilities include:
   -The sword was created to kill a particular ethnic group in a war;
    that ethnic group subsequently won the war, and it turns out that all
    the PC's but the chosen carrier are descended in some way from that
    ethnic group. Over the course of the journey, that PC argues with the
    sword over whether or not the other PC's should be killed.  (PC:  "It
    will be rather a long fight if I have to kill everyone in the
    province"   SWORD:  "But the glorious fight will at last be won!")
   -The sword is a Lawful Good sword created a millennium ago, when
    morals were considerably different.  *It* wants to encourage the kind
    of behaviour that it believes is good, probably rough eye-for-an-eye
    justice that is frowned upon in most civilized societies.
   -The sword is a weapon to be used in an upcoming Apocalyptic War
    between Good and Evil (tm) and is searching for the best Hero (tm)
    for the war.  In this case, the PC's are simply a vehicle for it to
    get to the capital.  It may have magical abilities that keep the PC's
    alive during the early parts of the journey, but after it leaves
    them, they must learn to live without it.
=========================================================================
   (This is an entire campaign, and begins with 1st level chars that have
never met each other.)
   Each PC is doing normal, everyday things (sword practice, study,
drinking, etc) when he is arrested by the city police (knocked unconcious
if they do not go peacefully).  The PC's all end up in the same jail
cell.  The next day, they are brought to trial for the murder of some
important official.  They are convicted and sentenced to burn tomorrow.
They are returned to their cell (stripped of all equipment) to await
their execution.
   The PC's have at least two escape paths:  (more, if they're creative)
     1) If they carefully search the cell, they can find a loose stone
under a cot (everyone gets a 'concealed doors' roll) (and if they look,
they will eventually find it: the odds are in their favor, if there are
more than a few PC's).  By falling through, they can drop into sewers,
float to the exit, batter away the grate, and they are free.
     2) Have a mage do something to the single guard (charm comes to mind
immediately)
   Once they are out, they must flee the city (if they try to stay, tell
them the police have noticed their escape, and are beginning a house-to-
house search.  This information could come from a bartender or similar
person.) They may wish to steal some equipment, or maybe a friend will
provide them with weapons, urging them to run.
   The PC's can travel either to the ocean (if they can capture a small
vessel) or to the unexplored mountainous regions.  There, they can gain
experience and hide until they are ready to return, and find out who
framed them for the murder.  (It was the judge, or maybe another
politician.  After killing the victim, he planted evidence pointing to
the PC's.  The PC's may have been political opponents of him, or just
randomly chosen.)
=========================================================================
"Double-Cross"

   The PC's are hired to retrieve a family heirloom which was stolen from
the family 5 years ago.  The family has just found who now has the
heirloom and want the PC's to steal it back.  The current owner is the
original thief and is an accepted member of the community (probably not
Lawful Good but not CE either).  The theft must be done quietly so as not
to attract attention as the familiy would lose social esteem if it was
known that the object had been lost i.e. no questions asked in town etc.
The current owner has a normal house with normal traps and precautions to
protect this type of treasure, plus whatever skills or guards are
required.
   After the theft has been performed, the object handed over and the
PC's are still congratulating themselves on a job well done, reward
posters go up around town for the return of the object, the thieves
wanted dead or alive or the object returned and no questions asked.  The
PC's have been suckered, the object has ALWAYS belonged to the person
they stole it from and they are forced to either flee the area (never to
return), or to get it back again from the person they originally stole it
for (probably a member of the local Thieves' Guild or similiar).  The
preferred method is to lead them toward stealing it back again (if they
can break into the thieves' guild etc) as there are no other safe
alternatives.  If they are captured, no-one will believe them unless the
PC's pay for a cleric to "Detect Lie" (very expensive under the
circumstances) and no-one will mind if they are accidently killed while
trying to retrieve the object.
   Last time I did this the object was a diamond tiara and used in royal
coronations (one of which was due in 2 months). Nearly brought the whole
political structure down.
=========================================================================
"Time War"

   An experimenting Cleric/Mage has opened a portal to another realm.
Accidently this corresponded with an experiment in a modern-day
underground military base which is performing a physics experiment on
time/space.  A trans-Time/dimensional portal is formed, both attuned to
each other such that neither can be closed until both are closed
simultaneously.  Meanwhile, a military scouting party of Rambo types have
passed through and are exploring the AD&D area (walky talkies, hand
grenades, sub-machine guns and pistols, hand-to-hand combat etc).  They
don't believe what they've ended up in (save vs illusions and mind-
affecting spells at +4) and are taking prisoners of anyone who can give
information on the situation.
   Problem 1:  Stop the scouting party (including retrieving their gear
if possible).
   Problem 2:  Find what equipment is needed to close both portals
simultaneously - sages can probably help with this - and get the required
equipment.  (I used a Redeye missile and Staff of power, both of which
were in the possession of a Barghest on the plane of Gehenna).
   Problem 3:  Go through the portal to the Underground base, find the
source controlling the portal, and get control of the area.  The guards
are the (US ?) army equiped with modern gear, but the primary security
structure is to block access to the experimental area, rather than the
area itself.
   Problem 4:  Destroy both portals simultaneously.  For example, fire
the missile into controlling computer complex, while simultaneously
breaking (retributive strike) the Staff of Power at the fantasy-side
entrance to the portal.  Then get the surviving PC's from the underground
base to their home realm (either use plane shifting magic or have a time
delay on the portal destruction).
=========================================================================
   The elderly Lord of a small adventuring town was found missing from
his home a after a visit from some strange men.  The man's family
determines that he has been kidnapped and hires the PC's to find him.
The PC's, following various clues, find the man, and, after a bit of a
fight with Kenku and (some other bird race) the Kenku call for a truce.
They say they were hired to kidnapped the man and the person who hired
them has not shown up with their money.  They want no more trouble with
the PC's and hand over the old man.  So far, so good.  What the PC's
don't know is that the 'man' they take back is actually the Kenku leader,
shape-changed into the old lord's appearance.  The Kenku were able to use
magic (my version allow them to be up to 3rd level mages) to ESP and
CHARM the lord into telling them about his home, servants and treasure.
All goes well until a few days after the PC's return the 'lord'. It seems
that most of the servants have been fired, guard captains dismissed for
failing in their duties, etc.  In other words, the 'lord' is clearing the
castle of any who could recognize a difference in him.  His family (if
any - in my campaign there was a granddaughter set off to a nunnery and a
son who was locked in the dungeon for treason - he was blamed for the
kidnapping!!) have been done away with and most of the loyal
servants/guards are gone.  The 'lord' has hired new 'people'; more Kenku
coming in as advisors, guards, etc.  Once this was done, they began
cleaning out the castle treasury.  Needless to say, the PC's will be
curious, and the townsfolk furious.  The 'lord' has diverted all monies
to his "new and worthwhile projects" while neglecting the town and
allowing things to decay.  In the meantime, servants (Kenku) are looking
for a ship (with a captain that would not ask questions) to come to the
castle's dock during the night.  This does not go unnoticed by the PC's.
It all comes down to the Kenku, loading the castle treasure into the
ship, and in the midst of this, the PC's come in and battle the Kenku and
their mercenaries.  They may also find the true lord and his son in the
castle dungeon.
=========================================================================
   The PC's, after wandering into the nearest town for some R&R, suddenly
find themselves drafted into an expeditionary army as a scouting party or
even a small, *expendable* unit with an NPC leader.  The pay is a little
money plus food and any necessary clothing.  If you want to be nice, you
may assign the PC's horses, if they don't have any.  As a scouting party,
the PC's don't have to travel with the main force of the army, which gets
rid of the possibility of *huge* battles.
   At this point the PC's have several options:
   -Join the army (possibly in anticipation of relieving the kingdom's
enemies of unnecessary wealth)
   -Play draft dodger and be chased by an elite group of warriors (plus
MU's and clerics, if you want to get nasty)
   -Pretend to join and desert at first opportunity (this would tend to
rocket the PC's to the top of the local "10 Most Wanted" list).
   Any way they choose, you can follow up with new ideas or just adjust
the outcome so they wind up back in the army.  The overall goal of the
army is up to you.  Whether it is to rescue a princess, lend aid to a
besieged town or outpost, explore uncharted territory, or even to defeat
an opposing army, the PC's need not participate in any large-scale
battles.  The job of scouting gives many opportunities for encounters.
Wilderness encounters, encounters with enemy forces, a ruined temple, or
a castle or two, are just some of the things that can be encountered.
Nature itself can provide lots of good role-playing opportunities.  For
example, do you make the dangerous trek over the mountains or go around?
How are you going to cross that rain-swollen river?  The possibilities
are endless.
   The total outcome of the whole campaign can also be the basis for
another adventure.  What happens if the army is defeated or routed? Do
the PC's try to carry on and compete the mission?  What will the PC's do
when they find themselves stranded deep in hostile territory or deep in
an uncharted wilderness?  If the campaign is successful, will the PC's be
tempted to split up by being promoted to higher positions in the
military?  Will the PC's distinguish themselves and become heroes or
celebrities?  Will they fail and be looked on as traitors and criminals?
The rewards can be great and so can the risks.
=========================================================================
   Baron Harksheen requests an audience with the adventurers.  Background
checks will reveal very little is known about this baron.  The local
vassal is named G'caird, and is a duke.  G'caird has never heard of
Harksheen.  Harksheen castle is rather remote, to say the least.
   If asked, Harksheen will relate a story about saving the life of one
of the kings' children several years ago, and how he received this barony
quite by surprise some years later.  If the party asks too many
questions, they may be imprisoned in the baron's dungeons.  The baron has
15 men at arms, and can command the skeletons which inhabit all of the
numerous suits of armor displayed in the great hall.  (Note that this
armor gives the skeletons much better than normal defenses and weapons.)
If the party notices the skeletons in the armor, the baron will claim
they are the remains of the great warriors who died in the armor.
   The Baron's story is that he would like to obtain a certain suit of
armor that has fallen out of sight.  He has uncovered some clues (which
he will be glad to show any mages in the group), that indicate that the
armor, called "The Hide of Harker", was interred with the remains of one
Keforid, apparently a priest of some sort.  The Baron would like to
commission the party to recover the armor, will provide escort and
livestock, and allow the party to keep all other booty.
   The Baron's real name is Harker, he's a demon.  The armor was once his
hide. Besides the defenses of the armor, and the fact that it is nearly
weightless, it has the following abilities:  Telepathy with Harker, sense
danger, protection from cold.  If Harker is killed, the telepathy
converts to a sort of scrying from his skull.  Without it, he is pretty
weak, but if he gets his hands on it (or rather, the other way 'round),
look out.  He will warn the party that the armor is cursed, and to be
careful not to wear it.  (It isn't cursed per se, but with it's special
abilities, wearing it might be a tip off.)  The real reason Harksheen
won't go after the armor himself is that the Wraith wearing the armor
would know what he was going to do next and would be an extremely
formidable opponent.
   If the party looks closely at the warrior statue in the crypt, they'll
notice that the base of the statue is a defeated demon who looks a lot
like the Baron.  One of the Tapestries depicts the skinning of the demon.
=========================================================================
   This plot can be used to get the party together.
   During the last few weeks, the characters have been hearing rumors of
bandit raids on caravans travelling the <insert appropriate direction
here> road.  These raids are carried out against fairly large and well
protected caravans, indicating a well prepared and large group of
bandits.  Regular travellers are almost never bothered.  (Note: In my
campaign, this is set in a largely agricultural area.  Locals aren't
worth it).
   In addition to the caravan raids, several minor officials and
merchants have been kidnapped and ransomed.  The bandits are well
informed, leading the local authorities to believe they may have an
informant in their midst.  Also a local minor cleric of the temple of
<insert local good deity here> has vanished without a trace.
   Some member of the party is contacted by the local government's
intelligence organization (preferably one that makes sense.  I have a
rogue/spy/courier in my group).  They are tasked with gathering a group
of adventurers to scout out the bandits and locate their lair.  They are
not to engage the bandits, as the city government is planning a full
scale attack.  They are also given some appropriate amount of money to
give the characters incentive.  The group gathered is not to know they
are working for the local government.  Let the player devise a cover
story.
   At the same time, a cleric/paladin character (hopefully of the same
temple as the one above) is contacted by the head of their order, and
instructed to find out what happened to the vanished cleric.
   For a more twisted plot, have a party thief in the group be contacted
by the local guild, and told about a supposed government expedition to
find the bandits.  Instruct the player to join the party and
sidetrack/stop them if possible.
   Behind the scenes, the bandits are actually not as powerful as it
seems.  It just so happens that the band's wizard has developed/found a
more powerful version of the sleep spell, which allows the bandits to
gain a great initial advantage.  Furthermore, they are working with the
local thieves' guild to plan their attacks and are sharing the profits
with the guild.  In return, the guild provides information and fences
goods for the bandits.  The thieves' guild would be most upset if their
safe and profitable arrangement is disturbed.
=========================================================================
   (This is played as semi-serious comedy and is a good way to lighten
PC's of extra equipment, normal and magic e.g. armour, swords, potions,
etc)
   The PC's hear rumours of a Dragon down the coast, not far (30 miles)
from the village through which they are currently passing.  The local
council can't afford to pay anyone to get rid of it but it's been a pest
to all the local fishermen for years.  (It used to be worse but has been
a bit quieter for the last 15 years).  The PC's will be heros and a small
reward may be found.  The Dragon is actually Puff the Magic Dragon (from
the song for anyone who knows it) and was drawn into this realm from the
dimension of Dreams by a young boy's imagination (young Jacky Papers).
They always used to play together terrorising pirate ships (fishing
boats) etc until Jacky outgrew his boyhood "imaginary" friend.  Puff has
become broken hearted with the loss of Jacky and just mopes around all
day in his cave (hidden in the mists of the coast).  He is also a
compulsive coward, and the only valuables he possesses are those things
he and Jacky collected when Jacky was younger (balls of string, used
pirate's flags, blocks of sealing wax etc).  Puff is a green dragon
(nonstandard) with a sonic breath weapon (his cry/wail) which
shatters/disintegrates metal/crystal etc within 40'-70' (save applies)
and does appropriate damage to people as suits the scenario.  He can wail
every 2nd round with NO limits and will usually do so (he really is
depressed).  (This makes it hard for fighters to do much to him unless
they are lucky with their magical armour, magical swords etc).
   At any time the PC's approach him he will be sobbing gently.  He is a
huge Ancient Dragon of green color (NOT a Monster Manual 1 Green dragon),
hit only by magic weapons and the tears he is crying (every round) are
actually large drops of acid (splash all within 20' for damage as
appropriate).  If they hurt him much at all, he will try to escape, still
sobbing and wailing.  Even when escaped, he will try to stay close to his
cave (Jacky's toys are there) unless it is too dangerous.  He will NEVER
try to seriously hurt anyone!  Any damage is incidental and caused by
crying.  If the PC's try to talk to him, he will check to see if Jacky is
with them, then stop communicating, breaking into even more heart-rending
sobs (tears in all directions - splashing out to 40' for 3 rounds).
   The preferred solution to all this, if they bother to actually find
out what's going on (the local sages/mages know and will explain for a
fee), is to either send Puff back to the realm of dreams (extra
adventure) or find Jacky Papers and reunite them (he is probably that
madman wandering the kingdom having lost his memory with a great feeling
of unease about dragons).
=========================================================================
"Artifact Search"

   (This is based in a world where some great despotic Wizard-kings used
to rule before the free races allied against them and collapsed their
rule, some time in the distant past.)
   Recently, a farmer in a rural area fell into an underground cavern
while hunting.  Within the cavern are remnants of a vanished culture with
gleaming buildings and strange creatures moving about on unknown errands.
The farmer fled the scene immediately but his stories soon spread,
prompting several expeditions by locals and greedy adventurers.  The only
person to return from these was found dead outside a village in the area,
clutching an object fashioned of a strange crystal form.  The area is now
treated with caution and fear.
   The mage who acquired the crystal form is now hiring a capable group
with the intentions of exploring further in search of greater treasures.
   Options:
     1) The item was actually an artifact from the Wizard Kings and where
there is one there should be others (Greed inspired).
     2) The item was a portion of an unknown artifact, the rest is
desired (Interest and fascination inspired).
     3) The item is now known to have been the key holding a major
servant of the Wizard-Kings imprisoned.  He/She/It is now free and the
PC's are required to capture/track/kill it.  (Fear and caution inspired).
Maybe the servant knows where some of the Wizard-kings are still alive,
hiding in suspended animation or with their souls held in a magical gem,
waiting their moment of rebirth.
     4) The item is actually a map to a hitherto hidden realm (in a
magically shielded valley or alternate dimension) where the cavern's
inhabitants have come from.  They have been preparing themselves for a
looting/slaving expedition into this realm and must be stopped before
they have a chance to expand out of their cavern.  (This sets up a
possible major campaign:  first clean out the cavern area, then gain
access to the hidden and unknown realm and scout it, then find those who
intend the raiding expeditions etc and stop them).
     5) The item is the key to time-travel.  The mage who has it wants to
travel back to the time of the Wizard-Kings, alter history so that the
Wizard-Kings win and rule with them over one of the realms.  He intends
to trick the PC's to act as his advance guards and protectors and take
them with him to spoil the plans of the allied free people.  (This would
involve lots of trickery and be sneaky to manage, as the players can't
find out what's going on until too late - at which point they will
probably want to stop him and go home again).
     6) The object has given its new master some great abilities and he
now wants to use the powers of the PC's to slowly build his personal
power until he is able to rule as the great Wizard-Kings ruled. (See 5).
=========================================================================
   In the far west, under a permanent cloud, sits the Obsidian Castle.
Twice it has protected some powerful beings bid of domination of the
world, twice is has been foiled.  But the Castle is patient, and is
already nuturing the third, who has already begun his march.
   The Castle is made of jet black obsidian, each block is exactly the
same size, mortared to the next with a dull brown film, the blood of the
victims sacrificed to build it.  Enchantment runs through the entire
structure, oridinary weapons can make no mark upon the walls.  The castle
is black - gloomy, and horrific. Light cannot travel far within it -
absorbed by the walls.  The floors within are pure black ebony, with no
trace of light or color.  It's hard to breathe in the castle, though
character never seem to run out of air.
   The castle actively protects the Dark Lord.  It has a nearly infinite
supply of glassy obsidian or ebony or black granite guardians.  Gargoyles
guard the upper heights, razor-winged obsidian bats range the great
halls, the moat has no water but is filled with delicately balanced
sheets of razor-sharp glass that would instantly shred anyone who fell
within, even in armor, for the points would find every gap and pierce the
body within.
   The Castle is the home and last redoubt of the Dark Lord.  Your
characters must raise an army to defeat his orcs, ogres and trolls.  They
must forge a treaty with the beings of the light and air - the eagles,
the ki-rin - to provide protection and cover against the Dark Lord's
leather-winged reptilian flyers.  But the army is mere diversion - to get
the players into the Castle.
   Deep inside the bowels of the Castle is a room perhaps 100 feet wide
and nearly as high, and paved with gold.  The walls are bright polished
marble, hung with cloth-of-gold and studded with endless tiny gems.  The
ceiling has an enormous crystal chandelier, whose bright glow is nearly
eclipsed by the six-foot-diameter gem on a low dais in the middle of the
room.  The gem is a composite, made of thousands of smaller gems, from
fist-sized to tiny grains, of every shape and kind.  They are packed into
a great sphere, facet-to-facet, edge-to-edge, and the sphere is alive
with light of every color in the spectrum.  Bolts of light flash from
point to point within - tiny dots in many colors swirl about inside.  The
evil spirit of the Castle - its "brain" - dwells within.  No living being
has ever entered this room - or even knows it exists, but until the gem
is destroyed, the Obsidian Castle will always rise again, and new Dark
Lords will threaten the world...
   Of course, you'll need to work out a lot of details, but this idea
should be good for three or four campaigns before they figure out that is
isn't "just another Dark Lord" but the Castle itself that is the real
enemy, and that destroying it is merely a temporary setback.  You'll need
to decide who built it, and why, and when.  You'll need more monsters in
the "broken glass" idiom - many people are afraid of broken glass, it's a
powerful symbol.  Perhaps the Castle is lit with black light torches -
you can see, though all is black and dark, and the flames rime the walls
with frost and burn like frostbite...

Long Summaries
---------------
=========================================================================
"Large Hideous Monsters"

   Mostly huge, garishly colored slimy monsters have overrun the
Eastmarch.  Refugees are crowding into the city, and a large refugee camp
by the north wall has been set up.  The Temple of Osiris is advertising
for adventurers.
   The monsters are all different.  Even the occasionally recognizable
monster is the wrong color, and they're mostly very underpowered.  One
refugee has been celebrated as a "Dragon Slayer", since he took out a
huge, firebreathing beast with one blow of his yard rake.  The tale
definitely grew in the telling, but the man, "Lucky" Luke Sty-walker,
former pig rancher, hasn't let it go to his head.  After all, after he
killed the "Dragon", a giant slug ate his house.
   On the other hand, there was the "killer bunny", that killed 6
sheepdogs and a wolf one night, right in the middle of town!  It would
have probably continued the rampage, except that it started to melt at
sunrise (a Rarebit of luck, that.)
   Finding the source of these monsters is the quest, obviously, and this
is not too difficult a task, as long as the adventurers don't get eaten.
Nearly every monster has left a clear and obvious trail.  The trails all
converge on a stream bed.  Near the headwater of the stream is a cave
mouth.  An idiot ogre couldn't miss the fact that major traffic has
issued from it.  Inside the cave mouth is a very standard set of caves,
caverns and corridors, unique only in the fact that all of the normally
expected cave denizens are absent from, or dead in, their lairs.  One
exception; the first side cave from the entrance has a very dead 12'
cavebear, and a very cute, and hungry, cavebear cub (about 60 pounds).
the cub is likely to attach itself to the first adventurer that doesn't
hurt it.  Like most Ursines, it is omnivorous.  Monsters issue from the
cave at about 5 per night (2d4/night), and come into being at the narrow
end of the large cavern.  Some don't even survive walking the length of
the room, which provides the heartier monsters with a much needed snack.
None of the monsters can eat anything terrestrial.  Well, they can chew
and swallow, but not derive sustenance.
   During the 12 phases of the creation, a light can be seen coming from
"somewhere else".  Careful attention will reveal that this `light' seems
to be coming from a desk lamp.  Also visible is a desk with a hunched-
over "dwarf" in outlandish garb (actually, it's a kid in a striped T-
shirt).  Anyone stepping into the circle of light will be transported
into a 12'x15' basement room filled with strange and wonderous objects,
most of which will not function properly if brought back to the "real
world" On the desk are the kid's `lucky dice', which are powerful magic
items, and radiate magic strongly (noticed on 11-, 8- by spellcasters).
These dice create monsters if rolled 12 times.  The monsters appear in
whichever universe the dice are NOT in.  the Dice can be easily destroyed
in either plane, but that destruction will close the trans-dimensional
door that is in the basement behind the desk (which is also obvious to
most adventurers.) While the door is open, anyone leaving the room will
be transported to their own world.  Also, magic and technology both work
in the basement room only (and in the cave).
=========================================================================
   On a hill near the characters' home village once stood a proud castle.
About forty years ago a mage resident there summoned up something he
couldn't handle, and it pretty much trashed the place.  The castle
consists now of the ruins of the outer towers and gatehouse, about twelve
towers in all, only a couple of which have even part of a roof, six inner
towers (including the inner gatehouse) most of which are in very much
disrepair, and the inner keep, which is mostly collapsed.  Most of the
castle walls are also torn down, and the moat is overgrown as well.
Under the main keep is a cellar (about three rooms worth.)  All of the
wooden buildings, interior wood etc. was burned.  The place is rumored to
be haunted, about twenty years ago old Fred went there and never was the
same since.
   The players recently found out that the guy that built the castle had
placed a mcguffin under the floor stones in each of the towers, and a
large one under the keep.  (The mcguffin is some sort of enchanted jewel
that was supposed to keep the castle from harm or something.  In
practice, any enchantment has long worn off, but the jewels should be
worth whatever is an appropriate amount in your campaign.)  The players
are the only people (that they know of) with this information, perhaps
they found it in a letter used as a bookmark in an old book.
   You should stock the castle mostly with animal, or animal-like
monsters.  Perhaps one tower is home to a couple of giant beetles,
another has some feral cats, another has some snakes.  A group of
brigands that operates in this neighborhood uses one of the more intact
towers as a camp, perhaps they have hidden some treasure under it,
perhaps several of them are there.  An old crone lives in one of the
towers, free rent you see.  She makes healing poultices (herbal gunk
etc.) for the brigands in return for food.  Treat her as a second level
MU with a charm person spell.  You might, if you like, put a more "real"
monster in the main keep, perhaps some sort of sentinel creature (ex. a
water weird, one of the really minor devils etc.).
   Wandering monsters.  Write up a wandering monster chart.  Some of the
entries should be true wandering things such as passing birds, cows etc.
Most of them should be the inhabitants of the towers.
   For example:
     1. 3 of the cats from tower #1 (night only)
     2. The old crone gathering herbs (day only)
     3. 1d6 of the giant rats from tower #7 (night only)
     4. A brigand patrol (details omitted).  If there are currently no
brigands, they are going to their camp in tower #9.  If there are
brigands in the camp, roll a d6, on a 1-3 they are going to the camp, on
a roll of 4-6 the brigands in the camp leave etc.
   Should the party go home before clearing out the tower, feel free to
replace any slain monsters with others, especially if some time has
elapsed.  For instance, now that the large snake has left, a weasel
family has made their home in the moat.  The brigands will not always be
there, sometimes there may be as many as (more than the party can handle)
planning a raid somewhere.  Be sure to indicate signs of some of the
animals, things like droppings, meal remains, shed carapaces etc.  The
brigands are not all that neat, there might be signs that they are around
such as the tower that they use as an outhouse, a pile of cow bones, a
copper penny with a recent date, a torn but unrotted rag etc.
=========================================================================
"Survival"

   This module is currently designed for 4-6 players of first and second
level, with about 5 to 7 total levels in the party.  It provides a way
for the party to meet without resorting to the trite "you're in a bar"
scenario.
   The geographic setting is the northern plains of a continent with a
cool to cold climate during the autumn season.  The party begins in a
country on the human side of a human/demihuman border.  The demihumans in
question can be either Goblins and Orcs or Goblins and Hobgoblins.  The
winter storms are expected to start sometime in the next 4 to 6 weeks,
which will close down the commonly used trade routes through the
mountainous plains to the northeast.
   Each character, except thieves, starts as a merchant, messenger, or
mercenary guard in a large caravan heading to another city further north.
The winter seems to be setting in early and the caravan master wants to
leave the city as soon as possible, due to a "special" package that a
local temple has given into his care.  The cleric(s) in the party are
sent to "guard" this package.  The fighters are mercenaries hired to
guard the caravan on its seven to eight day journey, and the magic users
are merchants (based on their nonweapon proficiencies) along for the
ride.
   During the first three to four days it becomes obvious to the fighters
that the caravan master is taking a less traveled route (which is faster
and dangerous) due to the package.  On the fourth night, a group of
thieves (some of which are PC's) from the main town catch up with the
caravan, and plan to steal the package and ransom it back to the temple.
While the attempt is in progress, the camp is attacked by a horde of the
demihumans which results in the eventual disabling of all the PC's.
   The PC's awaken (roughly at the same time) with 1 HP, no equipment,
money, food, or water, in the middle of a wrecked camp.  The PC's must
"introduce" themselves, leading to a possible confrontation with the
thief character(s), since no one knows who they are or where they are
from.  They must then gather what equipment they can find and attempt to
make it back to civilization and SURVIVE.  The obvious choice is to press
onward toward the original destination.
   Unknown to the party, the demihumans' camp is nearby.  It is the only
source of food and water for miles in the surrounding terrain.  The party
should stumble upon a patrol, and gain some additional items.  From here
they can disguise themselves to gain access to the camp and possibly
steal food, water, and possibly horses.
   When the party finds the camp, they discover it is actually the ruins
of an ancient fortress.  Several questions come up:  Who is leading this
company of bandits?  What is their purpose?  Are they a threat (to the
greater civilization)?  The party may investigate these questions.  If
they do, several options exist for the adventure from this point.  Do
they try and defeat the leaders?  Reconnoiter to gather more information
to answer some of the above questions?  Try and find the treasure trove?
Run?  As they investigate the ruined fortress, they gain the opportunity
to do all of the above and more.  The dungeon also provides opportunities
to introduce replacements for characters who may have died.
   The adventure concludes with the PC's leaving the demihuman camp and
finishing the 2 to 3 day trek to civilization on foot, leaving the
bandits intact for a second adventure.
=========================================================================
   The background is that one of the characters in the campaign, has some
major bodily damage, beyond the capabilities of the party to heal.  They
rush him to town to find a healer.
   The healer heals the character, but tells the party that it is only
temporary.  He says that the character will need the application of a
special herb to make the healing permanent.  The healer tells the party
how to find a Druid whom he knows for the whereabouts of the herb.  The
party is able to get the Druid to agree to accompany them.
   The Druid knows the general area in which the herb grows.  Finding the
herb is not a guarantee.  After a trip taking several days into the
outback, and approximately one day of unsuccessful searching for the
herb, the party has an encounter with a group of orcs.  (Party ambushes
orcs, orcs ambush party, whatever).  When searched, at least one of the
orcs will have a small quanity of herb on his person.  If all the orcs
are dead the party will be able to track the orcs to their 'lair'.  If
one is alive, he will bring the party to the 'lair' if threatened.  If
asked about the herb, the orc is not aware that it is anything special.
(The orcs gather quantities of the herb and use it as a narcotic and are
unaware of the herb's healing powers, as they smoke it - not the proper
form of application.  If any orcs are questioned about the herb, treat it
as if someone on the street beat you up, took your cigarettes and asked
about their 'special healing properties'.)
   The orc 'lair' is actually a small village/outpost.  If this region is
orc infested, make it a village (they have to come from somewhere).  If
the region is relatively orc-free, have it an advanced orc outpost. (i.e.
no non-combatants)
   Have enough orcs in the 'lair' such that a frontal assualt would be
nearly impossible.  Sneakiness counts here folks!
   The 'lair' is actually above ground.  It consists of a group of huts
sufficent for the orcs' purpose.  (Housing, maybe a forge, food, armory,
etc.)  Two of the structures will be made of stone, the places occupied
by the priests and the high leaders.  The entire village is surrounded by
a wooden palisade.  (Think of old forts in western movies.)  The logs are
buried deep enough so that they cannot be easily moved.  The wall is nine
feet high with points at the top, and is treated with a sap-like residue
from the local trees that make it nearly resistant to fire.  (Fires take
more time to start and don't spread fast.)  The walls are not tough to
climb by oneself and are easy with the help of another.  Within the walls
are several outpost towers (approx. 15 feet tall) that are used to see
out beyond the walls.
   The orcs have enough of the herb to take care of the injured
character, plus possibly some left over for the party.
   For combatants, remember that in an organization this size there will
be a chain of command.  I had a supreme leader, a second in command, a
handful of lieutenants, many sergeants and about 150 standard fighters.
I also used two spell-users to make things more lively (players
occasionally fall into the trap in which they believe they are the only
ones with magic accessible to them) and an ogre to make things exciting.
I also included 20 worgs in a pen.  (Worgs are large semi-intelligent,
evil wolves that orcs occasionally ride into battle, also called dire
wolves.)  The worgs will only affect the outcome if either released from
the pen or if the party tries to sneak by them.
   If any of the party escape and at least one of the others are
captured, one of the spell-users will attempt to charm the character.
Once charmed the character will be instructed to find the rest of the
group and bring them back to 'rescue' their comrades.  (This is a -great-
chance for roleplaying for the the player involved!)  Set up an
appropriate ambush.  If the orcs' plan to entice the players back seems to
have too many holes in it, that's ok, orcs aren't renowned for their great
plans.
   The herb, in addition to its healing properties is also addictive.
For healing, the herb must be administered over a one week period.  In
games terms, withdrawal from the herb will result in a penalty to action.
Withdrawal will be complete five days after the last time the herb was
administered.  During these five days, the penalties should peak at day
three then gradually drop off.  Since the herb has a side-effect
(withdrawal), races that have a natural resistance to poison will not
benefit fully from the herb.
=========================================================================
   This plot is good for fantasy RPGs (designed for AD&D, approx. 6
characters of 6th-8th level)
   A small farming community several miles from where the characters are
based has made an appeal to the mayor of the village to put an end to
what are described as "dragon raids".  The mayor, who is coming up for
re-election, has heard of the fame of the heroes and comes to them for
help in slaying the dragon that has terrorized his constituents.

What the heroes are told:
-------------------------
   Recently (in the last few weeks), a dragon with green skin has
shambled up out of the nearby marsh and carried off livestock in its
mouth.  The farmers are upset at this loss of their resources.  A group
of the farmers held a meeting and sent two volunteers out into the swamp,
but they have not been heard from since.

What the heroes will find, upon investigation:
----------------------------------------------
   Large, muddy footprints on the grounds of the farmers whose livestock
have been stolen--mostly those living right next to the marsh to take
advantage of the fertile ground--ostensibly "dragon tracks".  If they ask
questions of the right people, they will find someone who swears he saw
the dragon change into a dragon-man and walk off into the swamp.  The
rest of the town thinks this old guy is nuts.  The dragon has not been
spotted any farther away from the swamp than about 30 yards.  None of the
townsfolk remember seeing any wings on the creature.

Some information the heroes *might* be able to discover:
--------------------------------------------------------
   Green dragons do not, by habit, live in marshland areas. They prefer
the serenity and relative abundance of game supplied by verdant forests.
Green dragons also delight in deceiving and controlling human operations.
A green dragon without wings is an oddity, to be sure.
   In fact, the kind of dragons who DO live in the swamp are black
dragons.
   None of this information should be available without sage
consultation.

What is actually going on:
--------------------------
   A little ways into the marsh is a small settlement of lizard men.
These are not the ordinary warlike race, but rather a pacifistic
offshoot... deadly when necessary, but downright friendly otherwise.
They are, in fact, farmers themselves, cultivating nutritious plants and
fungi, and keeping their own herd animals: giant lizards.
   The harvest has been bad this year, and feeding the giant lizards has
become second priority.  So the lizards, starving, wandered off towards
the human village in search of food...and found it.
   The human farmers wouldn't know a dragon from an oversized water
snake, so they naturally panicked.  No farmer in his right mind would go
dragon hunting in a swamp, nohow.  And the story grew a little more
fantastic with each telling....
   Once, the lizard men followed one of the lizards toward the human
farms.  It was near dusk, and visibility was poor, so it was an easy
mistake to say that the "dragon" had changed into a "dragon-man".  But
overall, the lizard men have avoided the humans for fear of prejudice and
misunderstanding.  If approached peacefully, and the situation is
explained, the humanoids will be willing to pay restitution for the
animals.  They are also willing to open a trade avenue with the humans,
if such an idea is acceptable, but that is up to the farmers.

Other goings-on:
----------------
   Elsewhere, *deeper* in the swamp, lairs an old black dragon.  He
sleeps, unaware of the turmoil occurring in the nearby village.  In fact,
the last time his sleep was disturbed was a couple of weeks back, when
two lanky humans intruded rudely upon his nap.  Fortunately for the
dragon, he happened to be mildly hungry at the time.
=========================================================================
   A noble requests the party to investigate a spook house he rents in a
town.  They are to locate, identify, and banish the source of the odd
sounds, sights, smells, or whatever.  For this, they will be paid
handsomely, since the noble likes the apartment's location as a perfect
"incognito" kind of place.
   The house with the apartment lies in a middle-class part of the town,
the buildings are not very crowded, but old.  The building is registered
in the name of one Raushof Gollenbacher, but any attempt to find out who
this person is, will fail; nobody knows. The proprietor is an old gnome
called Muschfyths, who don't like people.
   Muschfyths -is- Raushof.  Raushof was a name he used when he bought
the house years ago.  He got fake ID papers from a human forger he knew
at the time - the forger later died in a traffic "accident" (these things
happen, you know...).
   If the party checks for the names of previous renters of the building,
the list will mysteriously have been destroyed in a recent fire, and
Muschfyths will have a bad memory.  If the investigators insist on
sleeping in the apartment at night, nothing will happen - the "ghost"
will only be present on nights the investigators are off the premises.
   If the rental contract is checked, any lawyer type person will see,
under close scrutiny, that it contains a clause denying the renter any
rights of having his/her money back, and a demand of three months advance
rent.
   The house is FULL of secret doors.  These doors lead into other rooms.
Depending on the basis of the effects:
   1) There _is_ indeed a ghost, or spectre, that creates the sounds, and
this ghost has been enslaved by Muschfyths, and kept on a magical jar
when not needed. The other rooms of the house will contain chains of
meta-steel (steel able to exist in both the ethereal and material
planes), jars of iron sulphate (substitute Stinking Cloud, any AD&D'ers
out there) and related "spooky"/scary things. These are applied by the
ghost when trying to scare the occupants. The ghost can be banished if:
      a) Muschfyths is killed. This will free the ghost/spectre from its
obligations to him.
      b) The jar is broken. The ghost no longer has a prison in this
world.  If Muschfyths is still alive, the ghost is still enslaved, but
can not be "turned off" until Muschfyths can find another suitable
prison.
      c) The ghost can be banished by a cleric of a God of The Dead or a
God of Healing (in Warhammer terms, Morr or Shallya).  If Muschfyths is
still alive, the chance of banishing is lowered.
   2) The sounds etc. are produced by mechanical devices built by
Muschfyths.  These devices will rely on technical knowledge far beyond
the understanding of any non-gnome player, and even to gnomes, they
appear strange.  Treat the machinery as "traps", and feel free to include
steam engines, "perpetuum mobile"s etc. to your heart's content.  The
characters will perceive the devices as magic unless they can detect they
are not.  (You might even want to make some of the devices magic...)
   The devices are placed in the rooms surrounding the apartment.
Muschfyths is the only person that knows how the things work.  It's VERY
dangerous to try and operate the devices without proper training - and if
the party finds the devices, Muschfyths will have disappeared...perhaps.

Data on Muschfyths:
   Race:  Gnome
   Age:  Above middle age (for gnomes, very old for humans)
   Physical:  Not very strong, somewhat agile
   Mental:  Very bright, VERY talented in either technical areas or magic
relating to beings of a spectral nature (depending on the "source", see
above)
   Psyche: Greedy, selfish, paranoid coward.  Can be considered being of
an evil alignment.
   Abilities: Depending on the "source" (see above):
      1) Identify Ethereal Undead, Ritual: Enslave Etereal Undead,
Ritual: Imprison Ethereal Undead.
      2) (TL stands for Technology Level) Ritual: Make/Unmake Strange
Device (TL +1), Operate Device (TL +1), Identify Device (TL +0).
      Also: Weapon Use: Knives and Daggers, Hiding: Urban, Culture:
Gnome.

                                 INTRODUCTION

        You hold in your hands one the Great Books of our century fnord.

        Some Great Books are recognized at once with a fusilade of critical
huzzahs and gonfolons, like Joyce's ULYSSES. Others appear almost furtively
and are only discovered 50 years later, like MOBY DICK or Mendel's great
essay on genetics. The PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA entered our space-time continuum
almost as unobtrusively as a cat-burglar creeping over a windowsill.

        In 1968, virtually nobody had heard of this wonderful book. In
1970,hundreds of people coast to coast were talking about it and asking the
identity of the mysterious author, Malaclypse the Younger. Rumors swept
across the continent, from New York to Los Angeles, from Seattle to St.
Joe. Malaclypse was actually Alan Watts, one heard. No,said another legend
-- the PRINCIPIA was actually the work of the Sufi Order. A third, very
intriguing myth held that Malaclypse was a pen-name for Richard M. Nixon,
who had allegedly composed the PRINCIPIA during a few moments of lucidity.
I enjoyed each of these yards and did my part to help spread them. I was
also careful never to contradict the occasional rumors that I had actually
written the whole thing myself during an acid trip.

        The legendry, the mystery, the cult grew slowly. By the mid-1970's,
thousands of people, some as far off as Hong Kong and Australia, were
talking about the PRINCIPIA, and since the original was out of print by
then, xerox copies were beginning to circulate here and there.

        When the ILLUMINATUS trilogy appeared in 1975, my co-author, Bob
Shea, and I both received hundreds of letters from people intrigued by the
quotes from the PRINCIPIA with which we had decorated the heads of several
chapters. Many, who had already heard of the PRINCIPIA or seen copies,
asked if Shea and I had written it, or if we had copies available. Others
wrote to ask if it were real, or just something we had invented the way
H.P. Lovecraft invented the NECRONOMICON. We answered according to our
moods, sometimes telling the truth, sometimes spreading the most Godawful
lies and myths we could devise fnord.

        Why not? We felt that this book was a true Classic (literatus
immortalis) and, since the alleged intelligentsia had not yet
discovered it, the best way to keep its legend alive was to encourage
the mythology and the controversy about it. Increasingly, people wrote
to ask  me if Timothy Leary had written it, and I almost always told
them he had, except on Fridays whem I am more whimsical, in which case
I told them it had been transmitted by a canine intellgence --
vast,cool,and unsympathic -- from the Dog Star, Sirius.
        Now, at last, the truth can be told.
        Actually, the PRINCIPIA is the work of a time-travelling
anthropologist from the 23rd Century. He is currently passing among us
as a computer specialist, bon vivant and philosopher named Gregory
Hill. He has also translated several volumes of Etruscan erotic
poetry, under another pen-name, and in the 18th Century was the
mysterious Man in Black who gave Jefferson the design for the Great
Seal of the United States.
        I have it on good authority that he is one of the most
accomplished time-travelers in the galaxy and has visited Earth many
times in the past,using such cover-identities as Zeno of Elias,
Emperor Norton, Count Cagliostro, Guilliame of Aquaitaine, etc.
Whenever I question him about this, he grows very evasive and attempts
to persuade me that he is actually just another 20th Century Earthman
and that all my ideas about his extraterrrestrial and extratemporal
origin and delusions. Hah! I am not that easily deceived. After all, a
time-travelling anthropologist would say just that, so that he could
observe us without his presence causing cultureshock.
        I understand that he has consented to write an Afterward to
this edition. He'll probably contradict everything I've told you, but
don't believe a word he says fnord. He is a master of the deadpan
put-on, the plausible satire, the philosophical leg-pull and all the
branches of guerilla ontology.
        For full benefit to the Head, this book should be read in
conjunction with THE ILLUMINOIDS by Neal Wilgus (Sun Press,
Albuquerque, NM) and ZEN WITHOUT ZEN MASTERS by Camden Benares (And/Or
Press, Berkeley, California). "We are operating on many levels here",
as Ken Kesey used to say.
        In conclusion, there is no conclusion. Things go on as they
always have, getting weirder all the time.

GREATER POOP:Are you really serious or what?
MAL-2: Sometimes I take humor seriously. Sometimes I take seriousness
humorously. Either way it is irrelevant.

GP: Maybe you are just crazy.
M2: Indeed! But do not reject these teachings as false because I am crazy. The
reason that I am crazy is because they are true.

GP: Is Eris true?
M2: Everything is true.
GP: Even false things?
M2: Even false things are true.
GP: How can that be?
M2: I don't know man, I didn't do it.

GP: Why do you deal with so many negatives?
M2: To dissolve them.
GP: Will you develop that point?
M2: No.

GP: Is there an essential meaning behind POEE?
M2: There is a Zen Story about a student who asked a Master to explain the
meaning of Buddhism. The Master's reply was "Three pounds of flax."
GP: Is that the answer to my question?
M2: No, of course not. That is just illustrative. The answer to your question
is FIVE TONS OF FLAX!

                THE FIVE COMMANDMENTS (THE PENTABARF)

The PENTABARF was discovered by the hermit Apostle Zarathud in the Fifth Year
of The Caterpillar. He found them carved in gilded stone, while building a sun
deck for his cave, but their import was lost for they were written in a
mysterious cypher. However, after 10 weeks & 11 hours of intensive scrutiny he
discerned that the message could be read by standing on his head and viewing
it upside down.

                         KNOW YE THIS O MAN OF FAITH!

I - There is no Goddess but Goddess and She is Your Goddess. There is no
Erisian Movement but The Erisian Movement and it is The Erisian Movement. And
every Golden Apple Corps is the beloved home of a Golden Worm.

II - A Discordian Shall Always use the Official Discordian Document Numbering
System.

III - A Discordian is Required during his early Illumination to Go Off Alone &
Partake Joyously of a Hot Dog on a Friday; this Devotive Ceremony to
Remonstrate against the popular Paganisms of the Day: of Catholic Christendom
(no meat on Friday), of Judaism (no meat of Pork), of Hindic Peoples (no meat
of Beef), of Buddhists (no meat of animal), and of Discordians (no Hot Dog
Buns).

IV - A Discordian shall Partake of No Hot Dog Buns, for Such was the Solace of
Our Goddess when She was Confronted with The Original Snub.

V - A Discordian is Prohibited of Believing What he reads.

IT IS SO WRITTEN! SO BE IT. HAIL DISCORDIA! PROSECUTORS WILL BE
TRANSGRESSICUTED.

A ZEN STORY

by Camden Benares, The Count of Five
Headmaster, Camp Meeker Cabal

A serious young man found the conflicts of mid 20th Century America confusing.
He went to many people seeking a way of resolving within himself the discords
that troubled him, but he remained troubled.
                                             One night in a coffee house, a
self-ordained Zen Master said to him, "go to the dilapidated mansion you will
find at this address which I have written down for you. Do not speak to those
who live there; you must remain silent until the moon rises tomorrow night. Go
to the large room on the right of the main hallway, sit in the lotus position
on top of the rubble in the northeast corner, face the corner, and meditate."
        He did just as the Zen Master instructed. His meditation was
frequently interrupted by worries. He worried whether or not the resr of the
plumbing fixtures would fall from the second floor bathroom to join the pipes
and other trash he was sitting on. He worried how would he know when the moon
rose on the next night. He worried about what the people who walked through
the room said about him.
                         His worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as
if in a test of his faith, ordure fell from the second floor onto him. At that
time two people walked into the room. The first asked the second who the man
was sitting there was. The second replied "Some say he is a holy man. Others
say he is a shithead."
                       Hearing this, the man was enlightened.

                   -  THE BIRTH OF THE ERISIAN MOVEMENT -
THE REVELATION

        Just prior to the decade of the nineteen-sixties, when Sputnik was
alone and new, and about the time that Ken Kesey took his first acid trip as
a medical volunteer; before underground newspapers, Viet Nam, and talk of a
second American Revolution; in the comparative quiet of the late
nineteen-fifties, just before the idea of RENAISSANCE became relevant....

        Two young Californians, known later as Omar Ravenhurst and
Malaclypse the Younger, were indulging in their habit of sipping coffee at
an allnight bowling alley and generally solving the world's problems. This
particular evening the main subject of discussion was discord and they were
complaining to each other of the personal confusion they felt in their
respective lives. "Solve the problem of discord," said one, "and all other
problems will vanish." "Indeed," said the other, "chaos and strife are the
roots of all confusion."


                         FIRST I MUST SPRINKLE YOU
                              WITH FAIRY DUST

Suddenly the place became devoid of light. Then an utter silence enveloped
them, and a great stillness was felt. Then came a blinding flash of intense
light, as though their very psyches had gone nova. Then vision returned.

        The two were dazed and neither moved nor spoke for several minutes.
They looked around and saw that the bowlers were frozen like statues in a
variety of comic positions, and that a bowling ball was steadfastly anchored
to the floor only inches from the pins that it had been sent to scatter. The
two looked at each other, totally unable to account for the phenomenon. The
condition was one of suspension, and one noticed that the clock had stopped.


There walked into the room a chimpanzee, shaggy and grey about the muzzle,
yet upright to his full five feet, and poised with natural majesty. He
carried a scroll and walked to the young men.

"Gentlemen," he said, "why does Pickering's Moon go about in reverse orbit?
Gentlemen, there are nipples on your chests; do you give milk? And what,
pray tell, Gentlemen, is to be done about Heisenberg's Law?" He paused.
"SOMEBODY HAD TO PUT ALL OF THIS CONFUSION HERE!"

And with that he revealed his scroll. It was a diagram, like a yin-yang with
a pentagon on one side and an apple on the other. And then he exploded and
the two lost consciousness.

ERIS - GODDESS OF CHAOS, DISCORD & CONFUSION

        They awoke to the sound of pins clattering, and found the bowlers
engaged in their game and the waitress busy with making coffee. It was
apparant that their experience had been private.

        They discussed their strange encounter and reconstructed from memory
the chimpanzee's diagram. Over the next five days they searched libraries to
find the significance of it, but were disappointed to uncover only
references to Taoism, the Korean flag, and Technocracy. It was not until
they traced the Greek writing on the apple that they discoveredthe ancient
Goddess known to the Greeks as ERIS and to the Romans as DISCORDIA. This was
on the fifth night, and when they slept that night wach had a vivid dream of
a splendid woman whose eyes were as soft as feather and as deep as eternity
itself, and whose body was the spectacular dance of atoms and universes.
Pyrotechnics of pure energy formed her flowing hair, and rainbows manifested
and dissolved as she spoke in a warm and gentle voice:

I have come to tell you that you are free. Many ages ago, My consciousness
left man, that he might develop himself. I return to find this development
approaching completion, but hindered by fear and by misunderstanding.

You have built for yourselves psychic suits of armor, and clad in them, your
vision is restricted, your movements are clumsy and painful, your skin is
bruised, and your spirit is broiled in the sun.

I am chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build
rhythms. I am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy
anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free.

        During the next months they studied philosophies and theologies, and
learned that ERIS or DISCORDIA was primarily feared by the ancients as being
disruptive. Indeed, the very concept of chaos was still considered
equivalent to strife and treated as a negative. "No wonder things are all
screwed up," they concluded, "they have got it all backwards." They found
that the principle of disorder was every much as significant as the
principle of order.

        With this in mind, they studied the strange yin-yang. During a
meditation one afternoon, a voice came to them:

It is called THE SACRED CHAO. I appoint you Keepers of It. Therein you will
find anything you like. Speak of Me as DISCORD, to show contrast to the
pentagon. Tell constricted mankind that there are no rules, unless they
choose to invent rules. Keep close the words of Syadasti: 'TIS AN ILL WIND
THAT BLOWS NO MINDS. And remember that there is no tyranny in the State of
Confusion. For further information, consult your pineal gland.

        "What is this?" mumbled one to the other, "A religion based on The
Goddess of Confusion? It is utter madness!"

        And with those words, each looked at the other in absolute awe. Omar
began to giggle. Mal began to laugh. Omar began to jump up and down. Mal was
hooting and hollering to beat all hell. And amid squeals of mirth and with
tears on their cheeks, each appointed the other to be high priest of his own
madness, and together they declared themselves to be a society of Discordia,
for what ever that may turn out to be.

Mal-2 was once asked by one of his Disciples if he often prayed to Eris. He
replied with these words:

No, we Erisians seldom pray, it is much too dangerous. Charles Fort has
listed many factual incidences of ignorant people confronted with, say, a
drought, and then praying fervently -- and then getting the entire village
wiped out in a torrential flood.

                     What We Know About ERIS  (not much)

The Romans left a likeness of Her for posterity-- She was shown as a grotesque
woman with a pale and ghastly look, Her eyes afire, Her garment ripped and
torn, and women look pale and ghastly when concealing a chilly dagger in their
bosoms.

Her geneology is from the Greeks and is utterly confused. Either She was the
twin of Ares and the daughter of Zeus and Hera; or She was the daughter of
Nyx, goddess of night (who was either the daughter or wife of Chaos, or both),
and Nyx's brother, Erebus, and whose brothers and sisters include Death, Doom,
Mockery, and Friendship. And that She begat Forgetfullness, Quarrels, Lies,
and a bunch of gods and goddesses like that.

One day Mal-2 consulted his Pineal Gland* and asked Eris if She really created
all of those terrible things. She told him that She had always liked the Old
Greeks, but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters. "They were,"
She added, "victims of indigestion, you know."

Suffice it to say that Eris is not hateful or malicious. But She is
mischievous, and does get a little bitchy at times.

*THE PINEAL GLAND is where each and every one of us can talk to Eris. If you
have trouble activating your Pineal, then try the appendix which does almost
as well. Reference: DOGMA I, METAPHYSICS #3, "The Indoctrine of the Pineal
Gland"

                              THE INSIDE STORY!

       The Law of Fives

        the Law of Fives is one of the oldest Erisian Mysterees. It was first
revealed to Good Lord Omar and is one of the great contributions to come from
The Hidden Temple of The Happy Jesus.
        POEE suscribes to the Law of Fives of Omar's sect. And POEE also
recognizes the holy 23 (2+3=5) that is incorporated by Episkopos Dr. Mordecai
Malignatus, KNS, into his Discordian sect, The Ancient Illuminated Seers of
Bavaria.
        The Law of Fives states simply that: ALL THINGS HAPPEN IN FIVES, OR
ARE DIVISIBLE BY OR ARE MULTIPLES OF FIVE, OR ARE SOMEHOW DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY APPROPRIATE TO 5.
        The Law of Fives is never wrong.
        In the Erisian Archives is an old memo from Omar to Mal-2: "I find the
Law of Fives to be more and more manifest the harder I look."

"You will find that the State is the kind of ORGANIZATION which, though it
does big things badly, does small things badly too."

                      THE MYTH OF THE APPLE OF DISCORD
        It seems that Zeus was preparing a wedding banquet for Peleus and
Thetis and did not want to invite Eris because of Her reputation as a
trouble maker.*
        This made Eris angry, and so She fashioned an apple of pure gold**
and inscribed upon it KALLISTI ("To The Prettiest One") and on the day of
the fete She rolled it into the banquet hall and then left to be alone and
joyously partake of a hot dog.
        Now, three of the invited goddesses,*** Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite,
each immediately claimed it to belong to herself because of the inscription.
And they started fighting, and they started throwing punch all over the
place and everything.
        Finally Zeus calmed things down and declared that an arbitrator must
be selected, which was a reasonable suggestion, and all agreed. He sent them
to a shepherd of Troy, whose name was Paris because his mother had had a lot
of gaul and had married a Frenchman; but each of the sneaky goddesses tried
to outwit the others by going early and offering a bribe to Paris.
        Athena offered him Heroic War Victories, Hera offered him Great
Wealth, and Aphrodite offered him the Most Beautiful Woman on Earth. Being a
healthy young Trojan lad, Paris promptly accepted Aphrodite's bribe and she
got the apple and he got screwed.
        As she had promised, she maneuvered earthly happeningsso that Paris
could have Helen (The Helen) then living with her husband Menelaus,King of
Sparta. Anyway, everyone knows that the Trojan War followed when Sparta
demanded their Queen back and that the Trojan War is said to be The First
War among men.
        And so we suffer because of the Original Snub. And so a Discordian
is to partake of No Hot Dog Buns.
        Do you believe that?
-------------------------------------
* This is called THE DOCTRINE OF THE ORIGINAL SNUB
** There is historic disagreement concerning whether this apple was of
metalica gold or acapulco.
*** Actually there were five goddesses, but the Greeks did not know the Law
of Fives.

POEE (pronounced "POEE") is an acronym for The PARATHEO-ANAMETAMYSTIKHOOD OF
ERIS ESOTERIC. The first part can be taken to mean "equivalent
deity,reversity beyond-mystique." We are not really esoteric, it's just that
nobody pays much attention to us.

MY HIGH REVERENCE MALACLYPSE THE YOUNGER, AB, DD, KSC, is the High Priest of
POEE, and POEE is grounded in his episkopotic revelations of The Goddess. He
is called [The Omnibenevolent Polyfather of Virginity in Gold].

The POEE HEAD TEMPLE is the Joshua Norton Cabal of The Discordian Society,
which is located in Mal-2's pineal gland and can be found by temporally and
spacially locating the rest of Mal-2.

POEE has no treasury, no by-laws, no articles, no guides save Mal-2's pineal
gland, and has only one scruple-- which Mal-2 keeps on his key chain.

POEE has not registered,incorporated, or otherwise chartered with the State,
and so the State does not recognize POEE or POEE Ordinations, which is only
fair, because POEE does not recognize the State.

POEE has 5 DEGREES:
        There is the neophyte, or LEGIONNAIRE DISCIPLE.
        The LEGIONNAIRE DEACON, who is catching on.
        An Ordained POEE PRIEST/PRIESTESS or a CHAPLIN.
        The HIGH PRIEST, the Polyfather.
        And POEE =POPE=.

POEE LEGIONNAIRE DISCIPLES are authorized to initiate others as Discordian
Society Legionnaires. PRIESTS appoint their own DEACONS. The POLYFATHER
ordains priests. I don't know about the =POPES=.

POEE & It's Priests

If you like Erisianism as it is presented according to Mal-2, then you may
wish to from your own POEE CABAL as a POEE PRIEST and you can go do a bunch of
POEE Priestly Things. A "POEE Cabal" is exactly what you think it is.

The High Priest makes no demands on his Priests, though he does rather expect
good will of them. The Office of The Polyfather is point, not to teach. Once
in a while, he even listens.

Should you find that your own revelations of The Goddess become substantially
different that the revelations of Mal-2, then perhaps the Goddess has plans
for you as an Episkopos, and you might consider creating your own sect from
scratch, unhindered. Episkoposes are not competing with each other, and they
are all POEE priests anyway (as soon as I locate them). The point is that
Episkoposes are developing separate paths to the Erisian mountain top. See the
section "Discordian Society"

ORDINATION AS A POEE PRIEST

There are no particular qualifications for Ordination because if you want to
be a POEE Priest then you must undoubtedly qualify. Who could possibly know
better than you whether or not you should be Ordained?

An ORDAINED POEE PRIEST or PRIESTESS is defined as "one who holds an
Ordination Certificate from the Office of the Polyfather."


        Seek into the Chao if thou wouldst be wise
        And find ye delight in Her Great Surprise!
        Look into the Chao if thou wantest to know
        What's in a Chao and why it ain't so!

Note to POEE Priests:

The Polyfather wishes to remind all Erisians the POEE was conceived not as a
commercial enterprise, and that you are requested to keep your cool when
seeking funds for POEE Cabals or when spreading the POEE Word via the market
place.

                          HOW TO START A POEE CABAL
                  WITHOUT MESSING AROUND WITH THE POLYFATHER

If you can't find the Polyfather, or having found him, don't want anything to
do with him, you are still authorized to form your own POEE CABAL and do
Priestly Things, using the Principia Discordia as a guide. Your Official Rank
will be POEE CHAPLIN for the LEGION OF DYNAMIC DISCORD, which is exactly the
same as a POEE PRIEST except that you don't have an Ordination Certificate.
The words you are now reading are your ordination.

HOW TO BECOME A POEE CHAPLIN

1. Write the ERISIAN AFFIRMATION in five copies.
2. Sign and nose-print each copy.
3. Send one to the President of the United States.
4. Send one to
        The California State Bureau of Furniture and Bedding
        1021 'D' Street, Sacramento CA 94814
5. Nail one to a telephone pole. Hide one. And burn the other.
Then consult your pineal gland.

                         = The POEE Baptismal Rite =
 This Mysteree Rite is not required for initiation, but it is offered by many
POEE Priests to proselytes who desire a formal ceremony.

1) The Priests and four Brothers are arranged in a pentagon with the Initiate
in the center facing the Priests. If possible, the Brothers on the immediate
right and left of the Priest should be Deacons. The Initiate must be totally
naked, to demonstrate that he is truly a human being and not something else in
disguise like a cabbage or something.

2) All persons in the audience and the pentagon, excepting the Priest, assume
a squatting position and return to a standing position. This is repeated four
more times. This dance is symbolic of the humility of we Erisians.

3) The Priest begins:
   I, (complete Holy Name, with Mystical Titles, and degrees, designations,
offices, &tc.), Ordained Priest of the Paratheo-anametamystikhood of Eris
Esoteric, with the Authority invested at me by the High Priest of It, Office
of the Polyfather, The House of the Rising Podge, POEE Head Temple; Do
herewith Require of Ye:

        1) ARE YE A HUMAN BEING AND NOT A CABBAGE OR SOMETHING? The Initiate
answers YES.
        2) THAT'S TOO BAD. DO YE WISH TO BETTER THYSELF? The Initiate answers
YES.
        3) HOW STUPID. ARE YE WILLING TO BECOME PHILOSOPHICALLY ILLUMINIZED?
He answers YES.
        4) VERY FUNNY. WILL YE DEDICATE YESELF TO THE HOLEY ERISIAN MOVEMENT?
The Initiate answers PROBABLY.
        5) THEN SWEAR YE THE FOLLOWING AFTER ME:
(The Priest here leads the Initiate in a recital of THE ERISIAN AFFIRMATION.)
The Priest continues: THEN I DO HERE PROCLAIM YE POEE DISCIPLE (name),
LEGIONNAIRE OF THE LEGION OF DYNAMIC DISCORD. HAIL ERIS! HAIL HAIL! HAIL YES!

4) All present rejoice grandly. The new Brother opens a large jug of wine and
offers it to all who are present.

5) The Ceremony generally degenerates.

                                                DO NOT PULL ON YELLOW TIP

3. And though Omar did bid of the Collector of Garbage, in words that were
both sweet and bitter, to surrender back the cigar box containing the cards
designated by the Angel as The Honest Book of Truth, the Collector was to him
as one who might be smitten deaf, saying only: 'Gainst the rules, y' know.

                            THE DISCORDIAN SOCIETY

The Discordian Society has no definition.

I sometimes think of it as a disorganization of Eris Freaks. It has been
called a guerrilla mind theatre. Episkopos Randomfactor, Director of Purges of
Our People's Underworld Movement sect in Larchmont, prefers "The World's
Greatest Association of What-ever-it-is-that-we-are." Lady Mal thinks of it as
a RENAISSANCE THINK TANK. Fang the Unwashed, WKC, won't say. You can think of
it any way you like.

AN EPISKOPOS OF THE DISCORDIAN SOCIETY
is one who prefers total autonomy, and creates his own Discordian sect as The
Goddess directs him. He speaks for himself and for those that say that they
like what he says.

THE LEGION OF DYNAMIC DISCORD:
A Discordian Society Legionnaire is one who prefers not to create his own
sect.

If you want in on the Discordian Society then declare yourself what you wish
do what you like and tell us about it or if you prefer don't.

There are no rules anywhere.            Some Episkoposes
The Goddess Prevails.                   have a one-man cabal.
                                        Some work together.
                                        Some never do explain.

                         THE PARABLE OF THE BITTER TEA
                                      by
                       Rev. Dr. Hypocrates Magoun, P.P.
                          POEE PRIEST, Okinawa Cabal

        When Hypoc was through meditating with St. Gulik, he went there into
the kitchen where he busied himself with preparing the feast and in his
endevor, he found that there was some old tea in a pan left standing from the
night before, when he had in his weakness forgot about its making and had let
it sit steeping for 24 hours. It was dark and murky and it was Hypoc's
intention to use this old tea by diluting it with water. And again in his
weakness, chose without further consideration and plunged into the physical
labor of the preparations. It was then when deeply immersed in the pleasure of
that trip, he had a sudden loud clear voice in his head saying "it is bitter
tea that involves you so." Hypoc heard the voice, but the struggle inside
intensified, and the pattern, previously established with the physical laboring
and the muscle messages coordinated and unified or perhaps coded, continued to
exert their influence and Hypoc succummed to the pressure and he denied the
voice.
        And again he plunged into the physical orgy and completed the task, and
Lo as the voice had predicted, the tea was bitter.

                                "The Five Laws have root in awareness."
                                        --Che Fung (Ezra Pound, Canto 85)

The Hell Law says that Hell is reserved exclusively for them that believe in
it. Further, the lowest Rung in Hell is reserved for them that believe in it on
the supposition that they'll go there if they don't.

A SERMON ON ETHICS AND LOVE

        One day Mal-2 asked the messenger spirit Saint Gulik to approach the
Goddess and request Her presence for some desperate advice. Shortly afterwards
the radio came on by itself, and an ethereal female Voice said YES?

        "O! Eris! Blessed Mother of Man! Queen of Chaos! Daughter of Discord!
Concubine of Confusion! O! Exquisite Lady, I beseech You to lift a heavy burden
from my heart!"

        WHAT BOTHERS YOU, MAL? YOU DON'T SOUND WELL.

        "I am filled with fear and tormented with terrible visions of pain.
Everywhere people are hurting one another, the planet is rampant with
injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers
imprison sons, children perish while brothers war. O, woe."

        WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THAT, IF IT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

        "But nobody Wants it! Everybody hates it."

        OH. WELL, THEN STOP.

        At which moment She turned herself into an aspirin commercial and left
The Polyfather stranded alone with his species.

the Real Imposter, and that those vibrations of his are actually an attempt to
subvert Dr. Mojo's rightful apostilic authority by shaking him out of his wits.

                          THE HONEST BOOK OF TRUTH
                   being a BIBLE of The Erisian Movement

                         and How it was Revealed to
          Episkopos LORD OMAR KHAYYAM RAVENHURST, KSC; Bull Goose
        of Limbo; and Master Pastor of the Church Invisible of
        the Laughing Christ, Hidden Temple of The Happy Jesus,
                  Laughing Buddha Jesus [LBJ] Ranch


                    From the Honest Book of Truth
                 THE BOOK OF EXPLANATIONS, Chapter 1

1. There came one day to Lord Omar, Bull Goose of Limbo, a Messenger
of Our Lady who told him of a Sacred Mound wherein was buried an
Honest Book.

2. And the Angel of Eris bade of the Lord: Go ye hence and dig the
Truth, that ye may come to know it and, knowing it, spread it and,
spreading it, wallow in it and, wallowing in it, lie in it and ,lying
in the Truth, become a Poet of the Word and a Sayer of Sayings -- an
Inspiration to all men and a Scribe to the Gods.

3. So Omar went forth to the Sacred Mound, which was to the East of
Mullah, and thereupon he worked diiging in the sand for five days and
five nights, but found no book.

4. At the end of five days and five nights of digging, it came to pass
that Omar was exhausted. So he put his shovel to one side and bedded
himself down on the sand, using as a pillow a Golden Chest he had
uncovered on the first day of his labors.

5. Omar slept.

6. On the fifth day of his sleeping, Lord Omar fell into a Trance, and
there came to him in the Trance a Dream, and there came to him in the
Dream a Messenger of Our Lady who told him of a Sacred Grove wherein
was hidden a Golden Chest.

7. And the Angel of Eris bade of the Lord: Go ye hence and lift the
Stash, that ye may come to own it and ,owning it, share it and,
sharing it, love in it and ,loving in it, dwell in it and, dwelling in
the Stash, become a Poet of the Word and a Sayer of Sayings - an
Inspiration to all men and a Scribe to the Gods.

8. But Omar lamented, saying unto the Angel: What is this shit,man?
What care I for the Word and Sayings? What care I for the Inspiration
of all men? Wherein does it profit a man to be a Scribe to the Gods
when the Scribes of the Governments do nothing, yet are paid better
wages?

9. And, lo, the Angel waxed in anger and Omar was stricked down to the
Ground by an Invisible Hand and did not arise for five days and five
nights.

10. And it came to pass that on the fifth night he dreampt, and in his
Dream he had a Vision, and in this Vision there came unto him a
Messenger of Our Lady who entrusted to him a Rigoletto cigar box
containing many filing cards, some of them in packs with rubber bands
around, and upon these cards were sometimes written verses, while upon
others nothing was written.

11. Thereupon the Angel Commanded to Lord: Take ye this Honest Book of
Truth to thine bosom and cherish it. Carry it forth into The Land and
Lay it before Kings of Nations and Collectors of Garbage. Preach from
it unto the Righteous, that they may renounce their ways and repent.

                          CONVENTIONAL CHAOS

GREYFACE

In the year 1166 B.C., a malcontented hunchbrain by the name of
Greyface, got it into his head that the universe was as humorless as
he, and he began to teach that play was sinful because it contradicted
the ways of Serious Order. "Look at all the order around you," he
said. And from that, he deluded honest men to believe that reality was
a straightjacket affair and not the happy romance as men had known it.

It is not presently understood why men were so gullible at that
particular time, for absolutely no one thought to observe all the
disorder around them and conclude just the opposite. But anyway,
Greyface and his followers took the game of playing at life more
seriously than they took life itself and were known even to destroy
other living beings whose ways of life differed from their own.

The unfortunate result of this is that mankind has since been
suffering from a psychological and spiritual imbalance. Imbalance causes
frustration, and frustration causes fear. And fear makes for a bad trip. Man
has been on a bad trip for a long time now.

It is called THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.

                DOGMA I - METAPHYSICS #2, "COSMOLOGY"*

                          THE BOOK OF UTERUS
                    from the Honest Book of Truth
                        revealed to Lord Omar

1. Before the beginning was the Nonexistent Chao, balanced in Oblivion by the
Perfect Counterpushpull of the Hodge and the Podge.

2. Whereupon, by an Act of Happenstance, the Hodge began gradually to
overpower the Podge -- and the Primal Chaos thereby came to be.

3. So in the beginning was the Primal Chaos, balanced on the Edge of Oblivion
by the Perfect Counterpullpush of the Podge and the Hodge.

4. Whereupon, by the Law of Negative Reversal,** the Podge swiftly
underpowered the Hodge and Everything broke loose.

5. And therein emerged the Active Force of Discord, the Subtle Manifestation
of the Nonexistent Chao, to guide Everything along the Path back to Oblivion
- that it might not become lost among Precepts of Order in the Region of
Thud.

6. Forasmuch as it was Active, the Force of Discord entered the State of
Confusion, wherein It copulated with the Queen and begat ERIS, Our Lady of
Discord and Gross Manifestation of the Nonexistent Chao.

7. And under Eris Confusion became established, and was hence called
Bureaucracy; while over Bureaucracy Eris became established, and was hence
called Discordia.

8. By the by it came to pass that the Establishment of Bureaucracy perished
in a paper shortage.

9. Thus it was, in accord with the Law of Laws.

10. During and after the Fall of the Establishment of Bureaucracy was the
Aftermath, an Age of Disorder in which calculation, computations, and
reckonings were put away by the Children of Eris in Acceptance and
Preparation for the Return to Oblivion to be followed by a Repetition of the
Universal Absurdity. Moreover, of Itself the Coming of Aftermath waseth a
Resurrection of the Freedom-flowing Chaos. HAIL ERIS!

11. Herein was set into motion the Eristic Pattern, which would Repeat Itself
Five Times Over Seventy-three Times, after which nothing would happen.

THE FIVE ORDERS OF DISCORDIA ("THEM")
Gen. Pandaemonium, Commanding

The seeds of the ORDERS OF DISCORDIA were planted by Greyface into his early
disciples. They form the skeleton of the Aneristic Movement, which over
emphasizes the Principle of Order and is antagonistic to the necessary
compliment, the Principle of Disorder. The Orders are composed of persons all
hung up on authority, security and control; i.e., they are blinded by the
Aneristic Illusion. They do not know that they belong to Orders of Discordia.
But we know.

1. The Military Order of THE KNIGHTS OF THE FIVE SIDED TEMPLE. This is for all
the soldiers and bureaucrats of the world.

2. The Political Order of THE PARTY FOR WAR ON EVIL. This is reserved for
lawmakers, censors, and like ilk.

3. The Acedemic Order of THE HEMLOCK FELLOWSHIP. They commonly inhabit schools
and universities, and dominate many of them.

4. The Social Order of THE CITIZENS COMMITTEE FOR CONCERNED CITIZENS. This is
mostly a grass-roots version of the more professional military, political,
acedemic and sacred Orders.

5. The Sacred Order of THE DEFAMATION LEAGUE. Not much is known about the D.L.,
but they are very ancient and quite possibly were founded by Greyface himself.
It is known that they now have absolute domination over all organized churches
in the world. It is also believed that they have been costuming cabbages and
passing them off as human beings.

A person belonging to one or more Order is just as likely to carry a flag of
the counter-establishment as the flag of the establishment-- just as long as it
is a flag.

THE FOLLOWING IS QUOTED FROM BERGAN EVANS
ON NORBERT WEINER, NUCLEAR PHYSICIST

        The second concept Wiener has to establish is that of entropy.
Probablility is a mathematical concept, coming from statistics. Entropy comes
from physics. It is the assertion-- established logically and experimentally--
that the universe, by its nature, is "running down", moving toward a state of
inert uniformity devoid of form, matter, hierarchy or differentiation.

        That is, in any given situation, less organization, more chaos, is
overwhelmingly more probable than tighter organization or more order.

        The tendency for entropy to increase in isolated systems is expressed
in the second law of thermodynamics-- perhaps the most pessimistic and amoral
formulation in all human thought.

        It applies however, to a closed system, to something that is an
isolated whole, not just a part. Within such systems there may be parts, which
draw their energy from the whole, that are moving at least temporarily, in the
opposite direction; in them order is increasing and chaos is diminishing.

        The whirlpools that swirl in a direction opposed to the main current
are called "enclaves". And one of them is life, especially human life, which in
a universe moving inexorably towards chaos moves towards increased order.


IF THE TELEPHONE RINGS TODAY..... WATER IT!

PLANETARY Pi, which I discovered, is 61. It's a Time-Energy relationship
existing between sun and inner plants and I use it in arriving at many facts
unknown to science. For example, multiply nude earth's circumference
24,902.20656 by 61 and you get the distance of moon's orbit around the earth.
This is slightly less than the actual distance because we have not yet
considered earth's atmosphere. So be it. Christopher Garth, Evanston

        One day Zarathud took his students to a pleasant pasture and there he
confronted The Sacred Chao while She was contentedly grazing.

        "Tell me, you dumb beast." demanded the Priest in his commanding voice,
"why don't you do something worthwhile. What is your Purpose in Life, anyway?"

        Munching the tasty grass, The Sacred Chao replied "MU".*

        Upon hearing this, absolutely nobody was enlightened. Primarily because
nobody could understand Chinese.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                           THE SACRED CHAO

THE SACRED CHAO is the key to illumination. Devised by the Apostle Hung Mung
in ancient China, it was modified and popularized by the Taoists and is
sometimes called the YIN-YANG. The Sacred Chao is not the Yin-Yang of the
Taoists. It is the HODGE-PODGE of the Erisians. And, instead of a Podge spot
on the Hodge side, it has a PENTAGON which symbolizes the ANERISTIC
PRINCIPLE, and instead of a Hodge spot on the Podge side, it depicts the
GOLDEN APPLE OF DISCORDIA to symbolize the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE.

The Sacred Chao symbolizes absolutely everything anyone need ever know about
absolutely anything, and more! It even symbolizes everything not worth
knowing, depicted by the empty space surrounding the Hodge-Podge.

HERE FOLLOWS SOME PSYCHO-METAPHYSICS.
If you are not hot for philosophy, best just to skip it.

        The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic
Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man made
concepts and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper
that is the level of distinction making.

        With our concept making apparatus called "mind" we look at reality
through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us. The
ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled "reality" and unenlightened
people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other
cultures, see "reality" differently. It is only the ideas-about-reality
which differ. Real (capital-T True) reality is a level deeper that is the
level of concept.

        We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids
(concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group
of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and
relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The ORDER is
in the GRID. That is the Aneristic Principle.

        Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one
grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one
that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened
westerners) be True. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the
ANERISTIC ILLUSION. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more
beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be
more True than any other.

        DISORDER is simply unrelated information viewed through some
particular grid. But, like "relation", no-relation is a concept. Male, like
female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is "absence of
female-ness", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically
arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE.

        The belief that "order is true" and disorder is false or somehow
wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the
ERISTIC ILLUSION.

        The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition
relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T)
Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid,
and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick
another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and
disordered.

        Reality is the original Rorschach.

Verily! So much for all that.

The words of the Foolish and those of the Wise
Are not far apart in Discordian Eyes.
(HBT; The Book of Advise, 2:1)

The PODGE of the Sacred Chao is symbolized as The Golden Apple of Discordia,
which represents the Eristic Principle of Disorder. The writing on it,
"KALLISTI" is Greek for "TO THE PRETTIEST ONE" and refers to an old myth about
The Goddess. But the Greeks had only a limited understanding of Disorder, and
thought it to be a negative principle.

The Pentagon represents the Aneristic Principle of Order and symbolizes the
HODGE. The Pentagon has several references; for one,, it can be taken to
represent geometry, one of the earliest studies of formal order to reach
elaborate development;* for another, it specifically accords with THE LAW OF
FIVES.

THE TRUTH IS FIVE BUT MEN HAVE ONLY ONE NAME FOR IT.
                                -Patamunzo Lingananda

It is also the shape of the United States Military Headquarters, the Pentagon
Building, a most pregnant manifestation of straightjacket order resting on a
firm foundation of chaos and constantly erupting into dazzling disorder; and
this building is one of our more cherished Erisian Shrines. Also it so happens
that in times of medieval magic, the pentagon was the generic symbol for
werewolves, but this reference is not particularly intended and it should be
noted that the Erisian Movement does not discriminate against werewolves-- our
membership roster is open to persons of all races, national origins and
hobbies.

                               BRUNSWICK SHRINE

In the Los Angeles suburb of Whittier there lives a bowling alley, and within
this very place, in the Year of Our Lady of Discord 3125 (1959*), Eris revealed
Herself to The Golden Apple Corps for the first time.

In honor of this Incredible Event, this Holy Place is revered as a Shrine by
all Erisians. Once every five years, the Golden Apple Corps plans a Pilgrimage
to Brunswick Shrine as an act of Devotion, and therein to partake of No Hot Dog
Buns, and ruminate a bit about It All.

It is written that when The Corps returns to The Shrine for the fifth time five
times over, than shall the world come to an end:

                                IMPENDING DOOM
                                  HAS ARRIVED
        And Five Days Prior to This Occasion The Apostle The Elder
        Malaclypse Shall Walk the Streets of Whittier Bearing a Sign
        for All Literates to Read thereof: "DOOM", as a Warning of
        Forthcoming Doom to All Men Impending. And He Shall Signal
        This Event by Seeking the Poor and Distributing to Them Precious
        MAO BUTTONS and Whittier Shall be Known as The Region of Thud
        for These Five Days.

As a public service to all mankind and civilization in general, and to us in
particular, the Golden Apple Corps has concluded that planning such a
Pilgrimage is sufficient and that it is prudent to never get around to actually
going.

An Illuminated Mind can see all of thses, yet he does not insist that any one

TO: REV. RAMPANT PANCREAS, tRRoCR(a)pttM; Colorado Encrustation

Brother Ram,

Your acute observation that ERIS spelled backwards is SIRE, and your inference
to the effect that there is sexual symbolism here, have brought me to some
observations of my own,

ERIS spelled fore-part-aft-wards is RISE. And spelled inside out is REIS,
which is a unit of money, albeit Portugese-Brazilian and no longer in use.
From this it may be concluded that Eris has usurped Eros (god of erotic love)
in the eyes of those who read backwards; which obviously made Eros sorE. Then
She apparently embezzeled the Olympian Treasury and went to Brazil; whereupon
She opened a chain of whorehouses (which certainly would get a rise from the
male population). I figure it to be this in particular because MADAM reads the
same forwards and backwards. And further, it is a term of great respect,
similar to SIRE.

And so thank you for your insight, it may well be the clue to the mystery of
just where Eris has been fucking around for 3125.

                                FIVE TONS OF FLAX!

                     DOGMA III - HISTORY #2, "COSMOGONY"
which is not the same as DOGMA I - METAPHYSICS #2, "COSMOLOGY" (Book of Uterus)

        In the beginning there was VOID, who had two daughters; one (the
smaller) was that of BEING, named ERIS, and one (the larger) was of NON-BEING,
named ANERIS. (To this day, the fundamental truth that Aneris is the larger is
apparent to all who compare the great number of things that do not exist with
the comparatively small number of things that do exist.)

        Eris had been born pregnant, and after 55 years (Goddesses have an
unusually long gestation period-- longer even than elephants), Her pregnancy
bore the fruits of many things. These things were composed of the Five Basic
Elements, SWEET, BOOM, PUNGENT, PRICKLE, and ORANGE. Aneris, however, had been
created sterile. When she saw Eris enjoying Herself so greatly with all of the
existant things She had borne, Aneris became jealous and finally one day she
stole some existant things and changed them into non-existant things and
claimed them as her own children. This deeply hurt Eris, who felt that Her
sister was unjust (being so much larger anyway) to deny Her her small joy. And
so She made herself swell again to bear more things. And She swore that no
matter how many of her begotten that Aneris would steal, She would beget more.
And, in return, Aneris swore that no matter how many existant things Eris
brought forth, she would eventually find them and turn them into non-existant
things for her own. (And to this day, things appear and disappear in this very
manner.)

        At first, the things brought forth by Eris were in a state of chaos
and went in every which way, but by the by She began playing with them and
ordered some of them just to see what would happen. Some pretty things arose
from this play and for the next five zillion years She amused Herself by
creating order. And so She grouped some things with others and some groups
with others, and big groups with little groups, and all combinations until She
had many grand schemes which delighted Her.

        Engrossed in establishing order, She finally one day noticed disorder
(previously not apparent because everything was chaos). There were many ways
in which chaos was ordered and many ways in which it was not.

        "Hah," She thought, "Here shall be a new game."

        And She taught order and disorder to play with each other in contest
games, and to take turns amusing each other. She named the side of disorder
after Herself, "ERISTIC" because Being is anarchic. And then, in a mood of
sympathy for Her lonely sister, She named the other side "ANERISTIC" which
flattered Aneris and smoothed the friction a little that was between them.

        Now all of this time, Void was somewhat disturbed. He felt unsatisfied
for he had created only physical existence and physical non-existence, and had
neglected the spiritual. As he comtemplated this, a great Quiet was caused and
he went into a state of Deep Sleep which lasted for 5 eras. At the end of this
ordeal, he begat a brother to Eris and Aneris, that of SPIRITUALITY, who had
no name at all.

        When the sisters heard this, they both confronted Void and pleaded
that he not froget them, his First Born. And so Void decreed thus:

        That this brother, having no form, was to reside with Aneris in
Non-Being and then to leave her and, so that he might play with order and
disorder, reside with Eris in Being. But Eris became filled with sorrow when
She heard this and then began to weep.

        "Why are you despondent?" demanded Void, "Your new brother will have
his share with you." "But Father, Aneris and I have been arguing, and she will
take him from me when she discovers him, and cause him to return to
Non-Being." "I see,"replied Void, "Then I decree the following:

        "When your brother leaves the residence of Being, he shall not reside
again in Non-Being, but shall return to Me, Void, from whence he came. You
girls may bicker as you wish, but My son is your Brother and We are all of
Myself."

And so it is that we, as men, do not exist until we do; and then it is that we
play with our world of existent things, and order and disorder them, and so it
shall be that non-existence shall take us back from existence and that
nameless spirituality shall return to Void, like a tired child home from a
very wild circus.

It also helps if one is absolutely zonked out of his gourd.

1. SAINT SECOND CLASS

To be reserved for all human beings deserving of Sainthood. Example: St.Norton
the First, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico (his grave
near San Francisco is an official POEE shrine.)

THE FOLLOWING FOUR CATAGORIES ARE RESERVED FOR FICTIONAL BEINGS WHO, NOT BEING
ACTUAL, ARE MORE CAPABLE OF PERFECTION.

2. LANCE SAINT

Good Saint material and definitely inspiring.
Example: St. Yossarian (Catch 22, Heller)

3. LIEUTENANT SAINT

Excellent Goddess-Saturated Saint.
Example: St. Quixote (Don Quixote, Cervantes)

4. BRIGADIER SAINT

Comparable to Lt/Saint but has an established following (fictional or
factual). Example: St. Bokonon (Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut)

5. FIVE STAR SAINT

The Five Apostles of Eris.

Note: It is an Old Erisian Tradition to never agree with each other about
Saints.

TESTS BY DOCTORS PROVE IT POSSIBLE TO SHRINK

                                =ON OCCULTISM=

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have
sought higher conciousness through assimilation and control of universal
opposites-- good/evil, positive/negative, male/female, etc. But due to the
steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the
shaman, occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important
pairs of apparent or earth-plane opposites: ORDER/DISORDER and
SERIOUS/HUMOROUS.

Magicians, and progeny the scientists, have always taken themselves and their
subject in an orderly and sober manner, thereby disregarding an essential
metaphysical balance. when magicians learn to approach philosophy as a
malleable art instead of an immutable Truth, and learn to appreciate the
absurdity of man's endeavours, then they will be able to pursue their art with
a lighter heart, and perhaps gain a clearer understanding of it, and therefore
gain more effective magic. CHAOS IS ENERGY.

This is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult
thought, and POEE is humbly pleased to offer the first breakthrough in
occultism since Solomon.

POEE ASTROLOGICAL SYSTEM

1) Om your next birthday, return to the place of your birth and, at precisely
midnight, noting your birth time and date of observation, count all visible
stars.

2) When you have done this, write to me and I'll tell you what to do next.


The Eminent 16th Century Mathemetician Cardan so detested Luther that he
altered Luther's birthdate to give him an unfavorable horoscope.



The theorem to be proved is that if any even number of people take seats at
random around a circular table bearing place cards with their names, it is
always possible to rotate the table until at least two people are opposite
their cards. Assume the contrary. Let N be the even number of persons, and let
their names be replaced by the integers 0 to N-1 "in such a way that the place
cards are numbered in sequence around the table. If a delegate D originally
sits down to a place card P, then the table must be rotated R steps before he
is correctly seated, where R=P-D, unless this is negative, in which case
R=P-D+N. The collection of values of D (and of P) for all delegates is clearly
the integers 0 to N-1,each taken once, but so also is the collection of values
of R, or else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time.
Summing the above equations, one for each delegate, gives S-S+NK, where K is
an integer and S=N(N-1)/2, the sum of the integers from 0 to N-1. It follows
that N=2K+1, an odd number." This contradicts the original assumption.

a different but completely equivalent problem, a generalization of the
nonattacking 'eight queens' problem for a cylindrical chessboard where
diagonal attack is restricted to diagonals slanting in one direction only.

                        THE CURSE OF GREYFACE AND THE
                          INTRODUCTION OF NEGATIVISM

        To choose order over disorder, or disorder over order, is to accept a
trip composed of both the creative and the destructive. But to choose the
creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order
and disorder. To accomplish this, one need only accept creative disorder along
with, and equal to, creative order, and also willing to reject destructive
order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder.

        The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into
order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of
building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential
positive/negative. He has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects
of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative
uses of disorder. Civilization reflects this unfortunate division.

        POEE proclaims that the other division is preferable, and we work
toward the proposition that creative disorder, like creative order, is
possible and desireable; and that destructive order, like destructive
disorder, is unnecessary and undesirable.

        Seek the Sacred Chao - therein you will find the foolishness of all
ORDER/DISORDER. They are the same!

                   ERISIAN MAGIC RITUAL - THE TURKEY CURSE

Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to the evil
Curse of Greyface, THE TURKEY CURSE is here passed on to Erisians everywhere
for their just protection.

The Turkey Curse works. It is firmly grounded on the fact that Greyface and
his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a
timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation.
The Turkey Curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes and
if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting (like a poet
working out word rhythms) it will prove harmless, or at worst, simply
annoying. It is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes, although
it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a
negative setting into a misguided eristic setting. in this instance, it would
be the responsibility of the Erisian Magician to manufacture the positive
vibrations if results are to be achieved. CAUTION- all magic is powerful and
requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician. This ritual, if
misused, can backfire. Positive motivation is essential for self-protection.

TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE:

Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for fisticuffs.
Face the particular greyfaced you wish to short-circuit, or towards the
direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize.
Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motionswith your hands
as though you were Mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess. Chant, loudly and
clearly:
                   GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!
The results will be instantly apparent.

                A PRIMER FOR ERISIAN EVANGELISTS by Lord Omar

        The SOCRATIC APPROACH is most successful when confronting the
ignorant. The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an arguement by
asking questions. You approach the innocent and simply ask "Did you know that
God's name is ERIS, and that He is a girl?" If he should answer "Yes." then he
probably is a fellow Erisian and so you can forget it. If he says "No." then
quickly proceed to:
        THE BLIND ASSERTION and say "Well, He Is a girl, and His name is
ERIS!" Shrewedly observe if the subject is convinced. If he is, swear him into
the Legion of Dynamic Discord before he changes his mind. If he does not
appear convinced, then proceed to:
        THE FAITH BIT: "But you must have Faith! All is lost without Faith! I
sure feel sorry for you if you don't have Faith." And then add:
        THE ARGUMENT BY FEAR and in an ominous voice ask "Do you know what
happens to those who deny Goddess?" If he hesitates, don't tell him that he
will surely be reincarnated as a precious Mao Button and distributed to the
poor in the Region of Thud (which would be a mean thing to say), just shake
your head sadly and, while wiping a tear from your eye, go to:
        THE FIRST CLAUSE PLOY wherein you point to all of the discord and
confusion in the world and exclaim "Well who the hell do you think did all of
this, wise guy?" If he says, "Nobody, just impersonal forces." then quickly
respond with:
        THE ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICAL GYMNASTICS and say that he is absolutely
right, and that those impersonal forces are female and that Her name is ERIS.
If he, wonder of wonders, still remains obstinate, then finally resort to:
        THE FIGURATIVE SYMBOLISM DODGE and confide that sophisticated people
like himself recognize that Eris is a Figurative Symbol for an Ineffable
Metaphysical Reality and that The Erisian Movement is really more like a poem
than like a science and that he is liable to be turned into a Precious Mao
Button and Distributed to The Poor in The Region of Thud if he does not get
hip. Then put him on your mailing list.

SINK

A GAME

by Ala Hera, E.L., N.S.; RAYVILLE APPLE PANTHERS

SINK is played by Discordians and people of much ilk.

PURPOSE: To sink object or an object or a thing...
in water or mud or anything you; can sink something in.

RULES: Sinking is allowd in any manner. To date, ten pound chunks of mud were
used to sink a tobacco can. It is preferable to have a pit of water of a hole
to drop things in. But rivers - bays - gulfs - I dare say even oceans can be
used.

TURNS are taken thusly: who somever gets the junk up and in the air first.

DUTY: It shall be the duty of all persons playing "SINK" to help find more
objects to sink, once; one object is sunk.

UPON SINKING: The sinked shall yell "I sank it!" or something equally as
thoughtful.

NAMING OF OBJECTS is some times desirable. The object is named by the finder
of such object and whoever sinks it can say for instance, "I sunk Columbus,
Ohio!"

In parks. On lots. Public flower beds. In remote places. At City Hall.
Wherever. Whenever. Or start a plantation in your closet (but read up on it
first for that). For casual planting, its best to soak them in water for a day
and plant in a bunch of about 5, about half an inch deep. Don't worry much
about the weather, they know when the weather is wrong and will try to wait
for nature. Don't soak them if its wintertime. Seeds are a very hearty life
form and strongly desire to grow and flourish. But some of them need people's
help to get started. Plant your seeds.

Make a few copies of this letter (5 would be nice) and send them to friends of
yours. Try to mail to different cities and states, even different countries.
If you would rather not, then please pass this copy on to someone and perhaps
they would like to.

THERE IS NO TRUTH

catastrophic, abominable, and outrageous disasters will happen. Except, of
course, from your seed's point of view.

3. All Chaos was once yer kingdom; verily, held ye dominion over the entire
Pentaverse, but today ye was sore afraid in dark corners, nooks, and sink
holes.

4. O how the darknesses do crowd up, one against the other, in ye hearts! What
fear ye more that what ye have wroughten?

5. Verily, verily I say unto you, not all the Sinister Ministers of the
Bavarian Illuminati, working together in multitudes, could so entwine the land
with tribulation as have yer baseless warnings.


DESPITE strong evidence to the contrary, persistant rumor has it that it was
Mr. Momomoto's brother who swallowed Mr. Momomoto in the summer of '44.

From: MAD MALIK Hauptscheissmeister

        Dear Brother Mal-2,

        In response to your request for unclassified agitprop to be inserted
in the new edition of PRINCIPIA, hope the following will be of use. And please
stop bothering us with your incessant letters!

        Episkopos Mordecai, Keeper of the Notary Sojac, informs me that you
are welcome to reveal that our oldest extant records show us to have been
fully established in Atlantis, circa 18,000 B.C., under Kull, the galley slave
who ascended to the Throne of Valusia. Revived by Pelias of Koth, circa 10,000
B.C. Possibly it was he who taught the inner-teachings to Conan of Cimmeria
after Conan became King of Aquilonia. First brought to the western hemisphere
by Conan and taught to Mayan priesthood (Conan is Quetzlcoatl). That was 4
Ahua, 8 Cumhu, Mayan date. Revived by Abdul Alhazred in his infamous Al Azif,
circa 800 A.D. (Al Azif translated into Latin by Olaus Wormius, 1132 A.D., as
The Necronomicon.) In 1090 A.D. was the founding of The Ismaelian Sect
(Hashishim) by Hassan i Sabbah, with secret teachings based on Alhazred,
Pelias and Kull. Founding of the Illuminated Ones of Bavaria, by Adam
Weishaupt, on May 1, 1776. He based it on the others. Weishaupt brought it to
the United States during the period that he was impersonating George
Washington; and it was he who was the Man in Black who gave the design for The
Great Seal to Jeffersson in the garden that night. The Illuminated tradition
is now, of course, in the hands of The Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria
(A.I.S.B.), headquartered here in the United States.

        Our teachings are not, need I remind you, available for publication.
No harm, though, in admitting that some of them can be found disguised in
Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, Burroughs Nova Express, the King James translation of
the Holy Bible (though not the Latin or Hebrew), and The Blue Book. Not to
speak of Ben Franklin's private papers (!), but we are still suppressing
those.

        Considering current developments--you know the ones I speak of--it
has been decided to reveal a few more of our front organizations. Your
publication is timely, so mention that in addition to the old fronts like the
Masons, the Rothchild Banks, and the Federal Reserve System, we now have
significant control of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (since Hoover died
last year, but that is still secret), the Students for a Democratic Society,
the Communist Party USA, the American Anarchist Assn., the Junior Chamber of
Commerce, the Black Lotus Society, the Republican Party, the John Dillinger
Die For You Society, and the Camp Fire Girls. It is still useful to continue
the sham of the Birchers that we are seeking world domination; so do not
reveal that political and economic cotrol was generally complete several
generations ago and that we are just playing with the world for a while until
civilization advances sufficiently for phase five.

        In fact you might still push Vennard's The Federal Reserve Hoax:
"Since the Babylonian Captivity there has existed a determined,
behind-the-scenes under-the-table, atheistic, satanic, anti-Christian
force--worshipers of Mamon--whose undying purpose is world control through the
control of Money. July 1, 1776 (correct that to May 1st, Vennard can't get
anything right) the Serpent raised its head in the under-ground secret society
known as the Illuminati, founded by Adam Weishaupt. There is considerable
documentary evidence to prove all revolutions, wars, depressions, strikes and
chaos stem from this source." Etc., etc., you know the stuff.

        The general location of our US HQ, incidently, has been nearly
exposed; and so we will be moving for the first time this century (what a
drag!). If you want, you can reveal that it is located deep in the labyrinth
of sewers beneath Dealy Plaza in Dallas, and is presided over by The Dealy
Lama. Inclosed are some plans for several new potential locations. Please
review and add any comments you feel pertinent, especially regarding the
Eristic propensity of the Pentagon site.

        Oh, and we have some good news for you, Brother Mal! You know that
Zambian cybernetics genius who joined us? Well, he has secretly co-ordinated
the FBI computers with the Zurich System and our theoriticians are in ecstacy
over the new information coming out. Look, if you people out there can keep
from blowing yourselves up for only two more generations, then we will finally
have it. After 20,000 years, Kull's dream will be realized! We can hardly
believe it. But the outcome is certain, given the time. Our grandchildren,
Mal! If civilization makes it through this crises, our grandchildren will live
in a world of authentic freedom and authentic harmony and authentic
satisfaction. I hope I'm alive to see it, Mal, success is in our grasp. Twenty
thousand years....!

        Ah, I get spaced just thinking about it. Good luck on the Principia.
Ewige Blumenkraft! HAIL ERIS.

                                        Love,
                                             MAD MALIK

Part Five     The Golden Secret


NONSENSE AS SALVATION

The human race will begin solving it's problems on the day that it ceases
taking itself so seriously.

To that end, POEE proposes the countergame of NONSENSE AS SALVATION. Salvation
from an ugly and barbarous existence that is the result of taking order so
seriously and so seriously fearing contrary orders and disorder, that GAMES
are taken as more important than LIFE; rather than taking LIFE AS THE ART OF
PLAYING GAMES.

To this end, we propose that man develop his innate love for disorder, and
play with The Goddess Erip. And know that it is a joyful play, and that
thereby CAN BE REVOKED THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.

If you can master nonsense as well as you have already learned to master
sense, then each will expose the other for what it is: absurdity. From that
moment of illumination, a man begins to be free regardless of his
surroundings. He becomes free to play order games and change them at will. He
becomes free to play disorder games just for the hell of it. He becomes free
to play neither or both. And as the master of his own games, he plays without
fear, and therefore without frustration, and therefore with good will in his
soul and love in his being.

And when men become free then mankind will be free.
May you be free of The Curse of Greyface.
May the Goddess put twinkles in your eyes.
May you have the knowledge of a sage,
    and the wisdom of a child.
Hail Eris.                                              T'AI

THE LAST WORD
The foregoing document was revealed to Mal-2 by the Goddess Herself through
many consultations with Her within his Pineal Gland. It is guaranteed to be
the Word of Goddess. However, it is only fair to state that Goddess doesn't
always say the same thing to each listener, and that other Episkoposes are
sometimes told quite different things in their Revelations, which are also the
Word of Goddess. Consequently, if you prefer a Discordian Sect other than
POEE, then none of these Truths are binding, and it is a rotten shame that you
have read all the way down to the very last word.

                         INTERVIEW WITH NORTON CABAL
                   by Gypsie Skripto, Special Correspondent

        It has been ten years since I net the mysterious Malaclypse the
Younger. I was free lancing for the underground papers and went to POEE Hear
Temple at 555 Battery Street to try for an interview.

        I found him in the Temple PO Box busy wrapping up the new Fourth
Edition of PRINCIPIA. He seemed impatient with me, insisting that he didn't
have the time or inclination for foolish questions from reporters. Undaunted,
I burst out with questions like whether he prefered Panama Red or Acapulco
Gold and how the fuck did we manage to fit inside of a tiny post office box
and other things apropos a naive young semiliterate dropout hippy writer. He
asked me if I wanted to drop mescaline and fuck all night and said he knew how
to turn himself into a unicorn and there might be room for a tiny interview on
the cover of the PRINCIPIA if I wanted to work for the GREATER POOP so I said
sure, OK, I've never dropped mescaline in a post office box before.

        It turned out I was among the last to see Malaclypse. As subsequent
issues of GREATER POOP revealed, he was to disappear and POEE business was to
be assumed by his students at Norton Cabal. Professor Ignotum P. Ignotius,
Department of Comparative Realities, was assignedthe Trust of the POEE Scruple
and Rev. Dr. Occupant became Keeper of the Box. The newly published copies of
PRINCIPIA were distributed by Mad Malik, Block Disorganizer, who had
distribution contacts with the Aluminum Bavariati. Practical relations
remained in the hands of concept artist G. Hill.

        When the 1000 PRINCIPIAS were gone the GREATER POOP stopped
publishing, Head Temple closed down and the Cabal just seemed to evaporate.
Finally even the box was closed. But over the years I noticed that copies were
still circuating, and that independent Discordian Cabal would occasionally pop
out of nowhere (and still do ). And I would wonder what ever happened to
Malaclypse.

        When I read the ILLUMINATUS trilogy I resolved to again find and
interview the denizens of Joshua Norton Cabal of the Discordian Society.

                                    * * *

        As I cabled over Nob to San Francisco's Station 'O' Post Office I
couldn't help but wonder at Goddess' hand in assigning street addresses to Her
outposts. Mal2 had told me that Good Lord Omar always filed everything under
"O" for OUT OF FILE.

        "Maya is marvelous" I was thinking when I rapped on the little metal
door and was greeted warmly by a huge beard who introduced himself as
Professor Ignotius. He ushered me into a spacious wood paneled and tapestry
hung parlor where three others were laughing and passing around a wine jug.
The sunny one in a tunic was the Reverend Doctor Occupant, the trim khaki and
jeans was Mad Malik and the wine jug claimed to be Hill. I got the recorder
on....

GYPSIE SKRIPTO [in response to a question]: ...1969 but only briefly. I guess
I missed you guys.

MAD MALIK: No wonder, he was pretty much a one man show then. We were just his
students and were usually off on errands. You worked for the POOP?

Gypsie: Well, for one night anyway. The interview is in the PRINCIPIA.

REV. DR. OCCUPANT: Malik wsa the only one he would ever let write for the POOP
or get on the letterhead.

Gypsie: Did you [Malik] have higher authority than the others?

Malik: No, [but I was allowed to speak in the POOP] because [Malaclypse the
Younger] hated politics. He was infuriated with Johnson and nixon over Viet
Nam because it was turning the renaissance into a political revolution and was
stealing his sacred thunder. So he trained me in Zenarchy, which he learned
from Omar, and I was the official anarcho-pacifist for the Cabal. Also I was
liason to The Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria, the Chicago Discordians.
Later Omar activated the Hung Mung Cong Tong and ELF, on zenarchist
principles, and also Operation Mindfock. I was also into those. Though at the
time I was masquerading in GREATER POOP as a created cabbage to throw off the
FBI.

Gypsie [to Hill]: Since you wrote it, I take it you are an anarchist?

G.H. Hill: Since then I have given up anarchy. Too many rules-- hating the
government and all that stuff.

IGNOTUM PER IGNOTIUS: It's like hating your own fantasies.

Malik: [Anarchy] is also standing up and proceeding forward, fantasy rule or
not. The condition is the same.

Occupant: Brother needs some wine!

Malik: We have had this arguement before, Reverend Doctor Brother. But wine
before platitudes, fill it up.

Gypsie [to Hill]: And pacifism?

Hill: I'm not sure I ever was one. Mal2 was not, Malik was. Personally I
accepted self defense yet I could never reconcile that with the ideal. I
finally gave up on that one too. Actually I just gave up on idealism.

Ignotius: Idealism lives with rules. Realism lives with rocks.

Hill: Yeah. I get along better with rocks.

Malik: Mal2 once told me that pacifism was a dilemma. If everybody was a
pacifist then everything would be perfect. But nobody is going to be a
pacifist unless I am first. But if I am and somebody else is not, then I get
screwed. He said that there were five choices under that circumstance. The
first was napalming farmers and the second was executing your parents. The
third was hypocrisy, the fourth was cowardice, and the fifth was to swallow
the dilemma. Zenarchists are trained in dilemma swallowing.

Occupant: So are other Erisians, like POEE.

Ignotius: That is characteristic of the Discordian perspective.

Hill: But of course training contradicts Discordian principles.

Malik: Oh so what. Contradictions are nothing to Discordians.

Occupant: Dilemma, Schilmemma. [to Gypsie]: What do you think of this, pretty
ma'am? We don't get to hear your thoughts.

Gypsie: I'm reporting now, you talk.

Occupant: Later then?

Gypsie: Perhaps. Later.

Occupant: You are smiling.

Gypsie: Hey, guy, later. [to Hill]: Doesn't this leave you a little schizy?

Hill: It's OK, I'm half Gemini.

Gypsie: What's the other half?

Hill: Taurus. That makes me a stubborn schizy.

Ignotius: I'm a Whale.

Occupant: I choose Satyr.

Malik: Spirits don't have signs.

Hill: A character can have a sign if I want it so.

Occupant: Well i can have a sign if I want to and screw both of you.

Malik: Come on Greg, you just think that we are your characters....

Occupant: You were inhabited by Malaclypse the Younger. He caused you to
create roles and those roles are being performed by us spirits.

Ignotius: A perfectly normal pagan relationship.

Hill: Well you can look at it like that if you want to, but I created Mal2 to
my specifications just as I conceived all the rest of you.

Occupant: You didn't invent Eris. She caused you to think you created the
spirit of Malaclypse.

Hill: Oh bull! Besides, I changed her so much the Greeks would never recognize
her.

Occupant: That's what She wanted!

Ignotius: Deities change things around all the time.

Malik: What you don't realize is that a spirit has a self identity.

Hill: Nope. A spirit is a product of definition and the one who is doing the
defining around here is me. Your identity is what I say it is. Just to prove
it, I'm going to change your name.

SINISTER DEXTER: It's OK with me. Fate is fate. I never much liked "Mad Malik"
anyway.

Ignotius: Besides people confused him with Joe Malik in ILLUMINATUS.

Dexter: I sort of onjoyed the confusion part.

Occupant: Doesn't prove anything anyway.

Gypsie: That name sounds familiar. Where is it from?

Hill: Its a name I came up with in the old days and never used it much. Its on
page 38 of the PRINCIPIA refering to Vice President Spiro Agnew. I always
thought I invented it but now it sounds like a Stan Freberg name now that I
think about it. It may have stuck in my preconscious memory from early TV.

Gypsie: Can you use it without his permission?

Hill: If it is his? I don't know. I hope so. it means "left right" in Latin
and is a perfect name for a libertarian anarchist. Actually in my kind of art
the question of what can I use freely and what can I not is a very tricky
problem.

Gypsie: How do you mean?

Hill: Well, take a collage for example. Like the early one on page 36 of the
PRINCIPIA. Each little piece was extracted from some larger work created by
some other artist and published and maybe copyrighted. I find them in
newspapers and magazines mostly. Often from ads. With a collage you select and
extract from your enviroment and then assemble into an original relationship.

The PRINCIPIA itself is a collage. A conceptual collage. All of it happens
simultaneously. But visually it is a montage, passing through time, like a
book does.

There is a lot of pirated stuff in the PRINCIPIA, especially in the margins.
But also I sympathize with artists who must own and sell their works to earn a
living. Art, like knowledge, should be free fodder for everyone. But it isn't
It is perplexing.

Gypsie: Where did all the things in PRINCIPIA come from?

Hill: Well, a full answer would take another book in itself. Most of the
writing credited to a name is a true person and almost always a different name
means a different person. Most of the non-credited, you know, Malaclypse, text
is mine although some things credited to either Mal2 or Omar were actually
co-written and passed back and forth and rewritten by each of us. The
marginalia, dingbats, and pasted in titles and heads and things came from
wherever I found them--some of which is original but uncredited Discordian
output, like the page head on 12 and other pages which is from a series of
satiric memo pads from Our Peoples Underworld Cabal. All page layout is mine
and some whole graphics like the Sacred Chao and the Hodge Podge Transformer
are mine but mostly I just found stuff and integrated it. Mostly I did
concept, say 50% of the writing, 10% of the graphics, all of the layout.

Gypsie: Specifically, what are some of the sources?

Hill: Weel, the poem on the front cover is by Walt Kelly and was spoken by one
of his characters in Pogo. The government seals starting from page 1 are from
a book of sample seals from the U.S. Government Printing Office. Western Union
on page 6 got into the act because I used to be a teletype operator and had
access to blank forms. Rubber stamps came from all over the place and some,
like the apple on page 27, I carved myself. A few I ordered to my
specification, like on page 1. The quote on the top of page 8 might be from
Barnum, I'm not sure. The jumping man on page 12 is from an advertisement. I
recognize the style--a popular commercial artist-- but I don't know his name.
The Chinese on the page is a grocery ad, I think. The Norton money on page 14
is historic,plus my little additions. The apple on page 17,as well as the
triangle on 23 and the Sacred Chao on 50 are, believe it or not, pasteups of
mimeographs, from Seattle Cabal. That group produced the best damn mimeography
I've ever seen. The Lick Here Box on page 23 is one of many tidbits making the
rounds in alternative/underground newspapers in those days. Trip 5 page header
on 29 was a chapter title in one of Tim Leary's books. The Knight on the bull
with the TV antenna on his helmet on page 46 came from a very artistic
magazine called Horseshit and put out by two brothers from Long Beach. I don't
remember their names. Wonderful magazine.

Occupant: Eris told Mal2 what to use and where to find it.

Hill: Yeah, in a way that is right. That is why my name does not appear
anywhere on the PRINCIPIA and why it was published with a broken
copyright--Reprint What You Like. I knew I was taking liberties and didn't
want my intentions to be misunderstood. It was an experiment and was intended
to be an underground work and that involves a different set of ethics than
commercial work.

Gypsie: There are no real names at all?

Hall: Oh, some. Camden Benares is a real name because he legally changed his
original name to his Holy Name. Also, instead of using Mordecai Malignatus I
used Bob Wilson's real name on page 12 because Werewolf Bridge was a work
before Discordianism. And of course real people like Neils Bohr crop up in
quotes.

Gypsie: What do you think about the PRINCIPIA now? Would you want to change it?

Hill: I consider it a successful work and I wouldn't want to change it. In
some ways it is immature and I am not the same person I was 10 years ago, but
it accomplished the objectives I set for myself and it has the effect I wanted
it to have. There are a few errors though.

Gypsie: Like what?

Hill: Oh, I changed a quote from Tom Gnostic on page 61 and I don't think he
ever did forgive me for it. He's right. Starbuck's Pebbles should have been
preceded by the Myth of Starbuck which was being saved for something else and
never got used. I should have used it when I had the chance. And then Eris did
a neat little trick on me by having IBM make the Greek selectric typewriter
element not coincide with all the characters on their keyboard. So the little
"kallisti" that appears on the title page and lastly on the back cover came
out "kallixti" and I was too dumb to know the difference.

Gypsie: Will there ever be a Fifth Edition?

Hill: There already is a Fifth Edition, by Mal2. It is a one page telegram
that reduces everything to an infinite aum. I found it at Western Union where
a machine got stuck and kicked out hundreds of pages of nothing but m's. He
made it the Fifth Edition and then left.

Principia/Malaclypse was a very personal work for me and actually took 10
years to culminate. it was one single statement that included my adolescence
in the 50's and my young adulthood in the 60's. When I finally had the
paste-ups done I knew that I had finished it. That is why, quote, Malaclypse
left. I knew it was finished. I didn't know exactly what it was, but it was
done.

Occupant: See?

Gypsie: Earlier you said that you met your objectives. Just what were those
objectives?

Hill: Well, that's hard to answer because it kept refining itself over the
years. In 1969 I mainly though of myself as a cosmic clown and I set out to
prove, by demonstration, that a deity can be anything at all.

In other words, people invent gods and not the other way around. Later I
decided that I was doing some kind of conceptual art.

In the 50's my culture taught me that I was created by and for a deity, a
specific male deity, and that all other deities are FALSE. Yet my growing
experience showed me that any deity is true in some sense and false in some
other sense. So I set out to do what my society told me is impossible--make a
real religion from a patently absurd deity.

In the 50's a female deity was blasphemy. In the 70's a humorous deity is
still considered impossible, ridiculous, and blashpemous. As far as I'm
concerned, I have proven my point. Eris is a real deity and even though I
don't promote Erisianism as a serious religion....

Occupant: I do!

Dexter: You speak for yourself.

Ignotius: Here, here.

Hill: ...I do point out that it makes just as much sense from its own
perspective as all the others do from each of their own perspectives.

Occupant: I think paganism is a valid spiritual path. I encourage Erisianism
because it makes fun of itself. i think this is healthy.

Ignotius: If you can live rewardingly with Goddess Eris you can live with any
deity, including none at all.

Dexter: I don't much go for the worship business but I argee with Occupant
about the spirit of the thing. We live in a time of turmoil, the whole planet
is in a state of change. If we, as a species, cower from the confusion then we
die with the dying. This is revolution.

Ignotius: I am an athiest myself. There is no Greg Hill.

[laughter]

Gypsie [to Hill] : What do you think of ILLUMINATUS?

Hill: Oh, I love it. I wwas finishing PRINCIPIA when Shea and Wilson were
working on ILLUMINATUS. It took Dell five years to publish it...maybe that is
significant. The 1969 Discordian Society was a mail network between
independent writers of various kinds. Norton Cabal was just me and my
characters and I used the other Cabals as sort of a laboratory. In return
other Discordians would bounce their stuff off of me. We would toss in ideas
and anybody could take anything out. It was a concept stew. The exchanging of
ideas and techniques broadened and encouraged all of us.

I like ILLUMINATUS for the surrealism. A very effective method of writing.

Ignotius: I got misquoted. Worse, I wasn't even in that scene and if I had
been then I would have said something else.

Dexter [to Ignotius]: That was me in that scene.

Ignotius: Oh, is that what that was?

Dexter: He got our names mixed up.

Hill: He got mixed up about me too, in COSMIC TRIGGER. Bob says that when
Oswald was buying the assassination rifle, my girlfriend was printing the
first edition of PRINCIPIA on Jim Garrison's Xerox. It wasn't my girlfriend,
it was Kerry's; it wasn't the FIRST ED PRINCIPIA, it was some earlier
Discordian thought; it wasn't Garrison's Xerox, it was his mimeograph; and it
wasn't just before Kennedy was shot but a couple of years before that.*

The FIRST ED PRINCIPIA, by the way, was reproduced at Xerox Corp when
xerography was a new technoloGypsie. Which was my second New Orleans trip in
1965. I worked for a guy on Bourbon Street who was a Xerox salesman by day.

Dexter: I think that George Dorn took too much guff from Hagbard. If someone
pulls a weapon on me, I'm more inclined to either leave or kill the
sonofabitch.

Occupant: You are supposed to be a pacifist.

Dexter: I'm speaking figuratively of course. I'll tell you more tomorrow.

Gypsie [to Hill]: Did you really translate erotic Etruscan poetry?

Hill: Sure, but I used a pen name. I signed it "Robert Anton Wilson".

[A quick rap is heard on the door]

Gypsie: I have only one question left...

Dexter: I'll get it.

Gypsie: ...what I really want to know is how can we all fit inside of a tiny
little post office box?

Dexter[to Gypsie]:It's a telegram for you, from Mal2.

Gypsie: To me?

[Paper tearing]

Gypsie [reading]: "If I told everybody how they could live inside of a post
office box then everybody would stop paying landlords and go live inside their
post office boxes. It would collapse the building! Can you imagine, post
offices collapsing all over the country, the hemisphere, the PLANET! The whole
world's communication system would be destroyed. No,no, I must not say. I dare
not!

-------------
* I checked this further with Mr. Thornley. He says that the woman in question
was not his girlfriend, she was just a friend, and it wasn't a couple of years
before Kennedy was shot but had to be a couple of years after (but before
Garrison investigated Thornley). --GS

                                   Broadcast Message 2; December 7, 1992

To the users of PCCTS,

PCCTS Version 1.06 is finally available.  This release is mostly a bug
fix and small feature update and does not constitute a major release;
hence, the manual has not been updated (a description of the new
features is available in TROFF, Postscript, and text formats).

For those users with anonymous FTP access: THE SITE HAS CHANGED TO:

                 marvin.ecn.purdue.edu

in the directory:

                 pub/pccts/1.06

Those with only email access mail send:

                 mail -s 'email README' pccts@ecn.purdue.edu
                 mail -s 'email UPDATE106.ms' pccts@ecn.purdue.edu
                 mail -s 'email install' pccts@ecn.purdue.edu
                 mail -s 'email one.c' pccts@ecn.purdue.edu
                 mail -s 'email pccts.bag' pccts@ecn.purdue.edu

Note that non-UNIX users will have to get files install.bag.reqd and bag.c
in addition.  See the README file.

The old ftp site still exists, but will not be updated.  Only the new
ftp site (or email) should be used for bug fixes, new releases, etc.

Items of note in the new version:

o Predicated Parsing--PCCTS now has the ability to allow semantics
  (arbitrary C expressions) to influence parsing; hence, context-
  sensitive translators may now be specified.  THIS FEATURE IS AN
  ALPHA RELEASE VERSION.

o ANTLR/DLG should compile without modification using either K&R or
  ANSI compilers.  It can be compiled with GCC 1.37 and 2.2 with
  -pedantic option (ANSI with extreme prejustice).  DOS and OS/2 even
  like it.

o 1.06 is written in itself: 1.00 or higher.

o The PCCTS source grammar files, antlr.g and dlg_p.g, are distributed
  with the 1.06 release

o A C program to generate makefiles for PCCTS projects

o DLG supports case insensitive scanners

o PCCTS can now delay lookahead until absolutely necessary whereas,
  before, parsers always maintained a buffer of k tokens of lookahead.

o Tutorials are available -- beginning and advanced

o Error messages for k>1 are vastly improved

o The trace facility now has an exit macro

o One can limit the amount of resources available to ANTLR grammar
  analysis to overcome the rare occurrences when ANTLR does not
  terminate.

o PCCTS parsers may now be compiled with C++ (tested with GCC 2.2)

If you are interested in sharing your experiences/problems/
successes/suggestions regarding PCCTS, please send email to
parrt@ecn.purdue.edu (a human).  Many people ask what others are
doing, but no one tells us what they are doing.  Also, feel free to
post messages to the comp.compilers newsgroup if you have
grammars/tools that might prove useful to others.


                PCCTS WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT

The next release of PCCTS, scheduled for Spring 1993, will include
code generation tools integrated into the PCCTS system.  We are
considering holding a two- or three-day workshop on use of PCCTS,
including the new features.

If there is sufficient interest, the workshop would be held at Purdue
University, in West Lafayette, IN.  Lafayette airport is just a few
minutes from Purdue; it is about 1 hour drive from Indianapolis or 2.5
hours drive from Chicago.  The course registration fee would be
nominal; course materials and on-line experiments would be included.
Discounted room rates, etc., should also be available.

If you are interested in attending, please send email to the PCCTS
server (pccts@ecn.purdue.edu) including the header line:

Subject: workshop

Sending this email does NOT oblige you to attend; we simply need this
information for scheduling purposes.  After we have made final
arrangements for the workshop, further information will be sent to you.


                       WHO USES PCCTS?

Although we will not make public the list of users of the PCCTS email
server, we thought you might be interested in a few statistics about
who is using PCCTS.  Note that this does not include users who simply
access our ftp site, any mirror site, Compuserve, or BIX; neither does
it include those who purchase PCCTS from Austin Code Works.

This information was obtained using a (not very clever) shell script
on Dec.  4, 1992:

Site count:      625 total
Known types:     171 .edu, 168 .com, 11 .gov, 11 .org, 6 .mil

Site countries:  439 US; 186 foreign:

The GNU superoptimizer (GSO) is now available for anonymous
ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu in /pub/gnu/superopt-2.0.tar.Z.

The GSO is a function sequence generator that uses an exhaustive
generate-and-test approach to find the shortest instruction sequence
for a given function.  You have to tell the superoptimizer which
function and which CPU you want to get code for.


Some GSO results:

  SPARC code for i5 = ((signed) i0 > (signed) i1):
	  subcc   %i1,%i0,%i2
	  srl     %i1,31,%i3
	  sra     %i0,31,%i4
	  addx    %i4,%i3,%i5

  Faster 80x86 code than the standard cmpl/seta/and for
  ecx = ((unsigned) eax > (unsigned) edx):
	  cmpl    %eax,%edx
	  sbbl    %ecx,%ecx
	  negl    %ecx

  MC88000 code for 'find first set bit', i.e., r6 = ffs(r2):
	  subu.co r3,r0,r2
	  and     r4,r3,r2
	  addu.ci r5,r4,r4
	  ff1     r6,r5

  POWER (RS/6000) code for r6 = ((unsigned) r3 < (unsigned) r4) + r5
	  sf      r6,r4,r3
	  sfe     r7,r5,r6
	  sf      r8,r7,r6

Aside from the CPUs in the examples above, GSO generates code for
MC680x0, Amd290xx, and Pyramid(SP,AP,XP).

Subject: recursion, type abbreviations, and abstract data types

Resent-From: Greg_Morrisett@VACHE.VENARI.CS.CMU.EDU

As Chris points out, this problem is not restricted to ML, but is a problem of
eager languages in general.  In our book, _Essentials of Programming
Languages_, we had the same problem with recursion.  In the book, we dealt
with it in two ways:

(1)  Our first approach, used in Sec 11.2, was to NOT use abstractions like
&&, and write out the parsing functions explicitly

(define parser
  (letrec
    ((non-term-1
       (lambda (item-stream)
	(cond
         ((......   (goto non-term-2))))))
      ...)
    ...))

where goto was defined by

(define goto
  (lambda (state)
    (lambda (buf stream)
     (state (first buf) buf stream))))

similar to Chris's $.  I'm not being entirely clear here [see the book for
details], but this should give you a flavor.

This, of course, doesn't give the level of abstraction of the signature-style
solution.

(2)  The second approach, used in Sec 11.5, was to represent the
functions built out of the signature as a data structure, and to use a small
interpreter to interpret the data structure as parsing functions.  This
actually works quite well.  The data structure is (roughly) an
association-list representation of an environment, so we can choose whatever
expansion strategy works best.

This works well in Scheme, but it's much uglier in ML.  A variant of this
approach, which I haven't actually tried, is to make the table the input to a
Scheme macro which would generate the appropriate code.  This would be quite
neat.  I conjecture that if ML had macros (hint, hint :-), this would probably
be the best solution.

After the flurry of correspondence on comp.lang.functional on functional
parsers, I put a copy of my class notes on this topic up for ftp.  These
discuss the techniques and relationships between them.  These can be gotten
from ftp.cs.northeastern.edu:pub/wand/parsers/* .  These are in Scheme, of
course, but translating them into ML should be easy: just erase all the
parentheses and infer the types :=))

subscribers should subscribe to the internet list, not the BITNET list.
BITNET subscribers may add (or delete) themselves by sending a SUBSCRIBE (or
SIGNOFF) request to the LISTSERV at NDSUVM1.

386USERS is a list for the discussion of Intel 80386 topics, including
hardware and software questions, reviews, rumors, etc.  It is open to owners,

          Standard ML weak polymorphism and imperative constructs

               My Hoang   John Mitchell  Ramesh Viswanathan
                     Department of Computer Science
                Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305
              {hoang, mitchell, vramesh}@cs.stanford.edu

                           Abstract

Standard ML uses ``weak type variables'' to restrict  the polymorphic
use of functions that may allocate reference cells, manipulate
continuations, or use exceptions. However, the type system used in the
Standard ML of New Jersey (SML-NJ) compiler has not been presented in
a form other than source code and has not been proved correct.
We present a set of typing rules, using only weak type variables
of a slightly more general nature than the compiler,
that appears to subsume the implemented algorithm.
One insight is that the indexed type of a free variable
is used in two ways, once in describing the applicative
behavior of the variable itself, and once in describing
the larger term containing the variable. This allows
us to formulate an application rule that is more general
than SML-NJ for applications of polymorphic functions
to imperative arguments. The soundness of the type system
is proved for imperative code using operational semantics,
by a technique that involves equivalence classes of related type
variables.

            A lambda calculus of objects and method specialization

                           Abstract

         This paper presents an untyped lambda calculus, extended with
      object primitives that reflect the capabilities of so-called
      delegation-based object-oriented languages.
      A type inference system allows static detection of errors,
      preventing {\it message not understood,}
      while at the same time allowing the type of an inherited
      method to be specialized to the type of the inheriting object.
      Type soundness, in the form of a ``subject-reduction'' theorem,
      is proved and examples illustrating the expressiveness
      of the pure calculus are presented.

====== INVITATION TO JOIN THE FREELORE PROJECT ==

FreeLore is useful information that is stored in
electronic or magnetic media and has a copyright
similar to that of GNU software.  FreeLore is not
a proprietary name or product, but an idea.  In
essence, it is the generalization of GNU software
to any kind of useful information.

You are hereby invited to join the FreeLore
Project as a charter member.

The provisional purpose of the FreeLore Project is
to organize volunteers to:

-- promote and encourage the production of free
educational and other useful materials
(``FreeLore'') in the electronic and
electronically-derived print media;

-- to define standards for FreeLore;

-- to promote active discussion of issues facing
the producers of FreeLore;

-- to capture and enhance (markup) public-domain data for
inclusion in FreeLore;

-- to provide information to persons interested in
using or writing FreeLore;

-- to promote efficient use of networks as a means of
providing access to FreeLore;

-- to organize and provide support services such
as archiving, markup, cataloguing,
self-registration of (self-)published materials,
and software maintenance;

-- to promote cataloguing standards for FreeLore;

-- to encourage electronic-media as the primary media
of scholarly discussion and journal publication;

-- to create copylefted or public-domain software for
creating, accessing, and viewing FreeLore;

-- to promote freedom of access to information in
whatever form generally.

Our first task will be to work out a real charter and
an agenda.

If you are interested, please send your contact
information, special concerns, and ways in which
you think you might be able to contribute to the
project to:

jgoodwin@adcalc.fnal.gov

Please indicate whether you have access to the
alt.uu.future newsgroup, or whether you obtained
this information by other means.

Announcing the GNU CD-ROM Edition 1.0
-------------------------------------

The Free Software Foundation has produced its first CD-ROM.  This CD
contains sources to the full distribution of the GNU Project
including: Emacs, GCC, G++, GDB, Bison, GAS, Make, GAWK, Texinfo, the
GNU Utilities, RCS and CVS, f2c, gnuplot, Ghostscript, tar, diff, and
BASH, as well as the MIT X Window System, MIT Scheme, the Andrew
Toolkit, and TeX.  Versions are current as of October 1992.

Also, the CD contains packages which run on 80386 or 80486 machines
under MS-DOS, including: Demacs (GNU Emacs for MSDOS), DJGPP (a port
of GCC 2.2.2), and MIT Scheme 7.2.  In addition, it contains Mtools,
which is a public domain collection of programs to allow Unix systems
to read, write, and manipulate files on an MSDOS filesystem (typically
a diskette).

The CD is in ISO 9660 format.  You can mount it as a read-only file
system on most operating systems.  Also, you can build most of this
software without needing to copy the sources off the CD; you need only
enough free disk space for the object files and the intermediate build
targets.  Except for several of the MS-DOS packages, there are no
precompiled programs on this CD.  You will need a C compiler (programs
which need some other sort of interpreter or compiler normally provide
the C source to a bootstrapping program).  The CD contains more than
46,000 files.

The CD costs $100 if you are an individual, $400 if you are a
business.  This is a distribution fee.  The software is `copylefted',
which means you have the the right to copy, change, and redistribute
it.

Please also consider adding a tax-deductible donation to your order.
Your donation will help to support the Foundation and make our future
efforts successful, including the development of new programs and the
continued maintenance of our existing software.  Donations are our
major source of income for program development.

For more information on GNU and the Foundation, contact us at:
	gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu
or the postal address on the order form.

gzip version 0.5 is available for anonymous ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu
[18.71.0.38], in the file /pub/gnu/gzip-0.5.tar.Z

gzip (GNU zip) is a compression utility designed to be a replacement
for 'compress'. Its main advantages over compress are better
compression and freedom from patented algorithms.  The GNU Project
intends to make this the standard compression program for its system.

gzip currently uses by default the compression algorithm used in zip
1.9 (the portable pkzip compatible archiver). The gzip format was
however designed to accomodate several compression algorithms.
gunzip can currently decompress files in gzip 'deflate' format, zip
format or 'compress' format. The detection of the input format is
automatic.

Subject: Re: movefile query

There are a couple longs for additional operation status codes in
a FIB. The Movefile primitive uses one of these (see the i/o support
manual chapter on ACP interface for detail) to report what the
movefile actually did.

Incidentally, I have implemented a softlink facility for VMS, embedded
in the filesystem, using some of the techniques described in the last
magic session at DECUS. (<evil grin for those who wanted humor and
didn't listen...you'll have to wait for the next symp. where I can
give a regular session...>). Unfortunately, not being DEC, it doesn't
er, I didn't use the normal directory file hooks...can't easily break
into the relevant parts of RMS. (Pardon the garble...someday I'll compose
using an editor :-) ).
   Forcing an open of another file is simple. The tricky stuff is handing
the markings in some kind of sensible way and getting the user channel
back where he expects it when close occurs. Fail to do that and all sorts
of odd, but generally harmless, things happen.
   There are conceptual issues too. On a VMS system, you can reasonably want
a link not to a device, but to a volume on that device. It's interesting to
check for these, but has to be a user option; imagine the pathological
case in which your hard disk farm has a bunch of softlinks to files on
different floppies, and only one floppy drive. Lots of deadlock possibilities
exist where applications try to open different combinations of files on
different volumes; fielding things correctly would require intercepting
read/write virtual and ensuring the correct volume was there before allowing
things to proceed. While this can be done, it's questionable whether anyone
would actually want to do it. ("seek time" takes on a whole new meaning when
it means rummaging thru a pile of floppies :-) for such a case...)

The following report is now available by anonymous FTP:

        "Polymorphic typing of an algorithmic language"

on nuri.inria.fr, file INRIA/publication/RT-0147.ps.Z.

This report is the English translation of my PhD thesis. This work
studies polymorphic type systems for three major imperative extensions
of ML: references, continuations, and first-class communication
channels.

The type systems are based on the ideas of dangerous variables and
closure typing, as presented in my POPL 91 paper with Pierre Weis. The
resulting type systems are much more expressive than SML's imperative
variables, leading to a much better support for generic functions
written in the imperative style.

This report also studies by-name semantics for polymorphism as an
interesting alternative to ML's by-value semantics in the presence of
imperative extensions.

This report can also be of interest as an exercise in structured
operational semantics, and in soundness proofs of type systems w.r.t.
this form of semantics.

     Standard ML# of Kansai : A new extension of Standard ML

I would like to announce a new extension of Standard ML, tentatively
called Standard ML# of Kansai. (Kansai is a region in western Japan,
which is, I guess, smaller than New Jersey.)  SML# extends SML with
polymorphic field selection and polymorphic non-destructive field
update operation.  Furthermore, these operations are always complied
into efficient code. (For a formal description of SML#, see my paper
"A Compilation Method for ML-style Polymorphic Record Calculi",
POPL 1992.)

A compiler is implemented by modifying Standard ML of New
Jersey version 0.75 compiler.

I intend to release the compiler of SML# to general public in near
future. Meanwhile, if you would try a preliminary version and be
willing to give me some feedback, please let me know.

FEATURE1 : POLYMORPHIC FIELD SELECTION.
SML expressions of the form

     #lab

or more generally

     fn {lab1=pat1,---,labn=patn,...} => exp

are given a polymorphic type and compiled to a polymorphic function.
(Note: "---" is meta level ellipsis and "..." is ML syntax for
"flexible record pattern".)  Here are simple examples:

     - fun polyXval {x,...} = x;
     val polyXval = fn : 'b#{x:'a,...} -> 'a
     - val colorPoint1 = {x=100,y=200,z=10,color="Green"};
     val colorPoint1 = {color="Green",x=100,y=200,z=10} : {color:string,x:int,y:int,z:int}
     - polyXval colorPoint1;
     val it = 100 : int
     - polyXval {x="123", y = "456"};
     val it = "123" : string

The notation "'b#{x:'a,...}" is a type variable "'b" with the record
kind "{x:'a,...}" denoting any record type that contains a field
"x:'a". As SML does for monomorphic selection, SML# compiles
polymorphic field selection to efficient index operation. (See
FEATURE3 below.)


FEATURE2 : NON-DESTRUCTIVE FIELD UPDATE.
SML# includes the following expression constructor (which is called
"modify" in my paper.) (The notation is a generalization of the
notation suggested by Dave MacQueen in his post to this mailing list.)

     #> exp => {lab1=exp1,---,labn=expn}

This creates a new record from exp by modifying the value of each
labi to expi, keeping all the others unchanged.  Here is an example.

     - fun moveXby1 p = #> p => {x = #x p + 1};
     val moveXby1 = fn : 'a#{x:int,...} -> 'a#{x:int,...}
     - moveXby1 colorPoint1;
     val it = {color="Green",x=101,y=200,z=10} : {color:string,x:int,y:int,z:int}
     - colorPoint1;
     val it = {color="Green",x=100,y=200,z=10} : {color:string,x:int,y:int,z:int}


FEATURE3 :  EFFICIENCY.
Polymorphic field selection in SML# is as efficient as monomorphic one
implemented in Standard ML of New Jersey. Here is a very simple
"benchmark":
(1) In SML of NJ version 75
Source code:
     fun don n f x = if n = 1 then f x else (f x;don (n - 1) f x);
     System.Control.Profile.profiling := true;
     fun Xval ({x,...}:{x:int,y:int,z:int,color:string}) = x;
     System.Control.Profile.profileOn();
     don 1000000 Xval {x=100, y=200, z=10, color = "Green"};
     System.Control.Profile.profileOff();
     System.Control.Profile.report std_out;
The result:
     Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 75, November 11, 1991
     Arrays have changed; see Release Notes
     val it = () : unit
     - use "test2.sml";
         ........
      %time  cumsecs     #call   ms/call  name
      96.78    20.50   1000000     .0051  Xval
       2.73    21.08         0            (toplevel)
        .47    21.18         0            (gc)
        .00    21.18         0            (unprofiled)

(2) In SML# of Kansai
Source code:
     fun don n f x = if n = 1 then f x else (f x;don (n - 1) f x);
     System.Control.Profile.profiling := true;
     fun polyXval {x,...} = x;
     System.Control.Profile.profileOn();
     don 1000000 polyXval {x=100, y=200, z=10, color = "Green"};
     System.Control.Profile.profileOff();
     System.Control.Profile.report std_out;
The result:
     % sml#
     Standard ML# of Kansai, Version 0-75, December 24, 1992
     Based on Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 75.
     val it = () : unit
     - use "test.sml";
        ........
      %time  cumsecs     #call   ms/call  name
      96.55    20.74   1000000     .0051  polyXval.anon
       3.07    21.40         0            (toplevel)
        .27    21.46         0            (gc)
        .09    21.48         0            (unprofiled)
        .00    21.48         1     .0000  polyXval


I hope that these extentions (or someting like them) be integrated in
the standard of future Stanrad ML.

The Soundness of a Formulation of Weakly Polymorphic References

			John Greiner
		School of Computer Science
		Carnegie Mellon University
			jdg@cs.cmu.edu

			Abstract

Adding ML-style references to a Hindley-Milner polymorphic type system is
troublesome because it is unsound to allow polymorphic generalization of
reference types in the usual manner.  Tofte introduced a distinction
between "imperative" and "applicative" type variables, such that applicative
type variables are never in reference types, that provides a simple static
analysis of which type variables may be polymorphically generalized.
MacQueen's "weak" type variables generalize imperative type variables with
a counter called a "strength".  The finer distinction allows a more
accurate analysis of when a reference may be created, and thus which type
variables may be generalized.

Unfortunately, weak polymorphism has been presented only as an algorithm in
the SML/NJ compiler, not as a formal type system.  As a result, it is not
well understood, as its more subtle points are not well known.  Furthermore,
while versions of the algorithm have repeatedly been shown unsound, the
concept has not been proven sound or unsound.  This paper presents a formal
system of weak polymorphism and a proof of its soundness.

	the RT-0147.ps.Z report is actually Xavier Leroy's
"Unix Systems Programming in CAML Light" manual (in French).
The English translation of his thesis is RR-1778.ps.Z. Both
look very interesting, but the ability to read French is
advantageous for the first one.

   Subject: exceptions (try/catch) in gcc

   I can not compile simple C++ programs which contain exceptions,
   such as described in appendix B of the Lippman book (2nd edition).
   I have tried with gcc 2.2.2 and 2.3.3 on a SunOS 4.1.2 machine.
   Try does not seem to be a key word, nor does throw.
   Should this work?  I thought gcc 2.x supported templates and
   exceptions...

   Joshua Levy  (joshua@veritas.com)

GNU C++ does support templates, but it does not (yet) support
ANSI-style exceptions.  Cygnus Support is targeting a June date for
the release of a version which supports exceptions.

        Several people have asked me about the email course on using the
Internet.  I mentioned it when sending the FirstSearch authorization and
password.

        The 3-week course, NAVIGATING THE INTERNET, began on November 16,
1992, and thus has been completed.  However, the lessons have been archived at
the listserver for the course, and can be obtained by email.
        To get an index of the lessons send an email message to:

                        listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu

           The message should just read:

                        index navigate

        To get a particular lesson send an email message to the same server.
        This message should read:

                        get navigate <filename of lesson>

        This is the same procedure you would use to get an index of the
files in the ROOTS-L listserver, and get a particular file.

        Two new books for beginners on the internet are:

          Kehoe, Branden. (1993?). ZEN AND THE ART OF THE INTERNET.

          Krol, Ed. (1992). THE WHOLE INTERNET: USER'S GUIDE & CATALOG.

I suspect others may want to know the following, so I will reply
publicly to the following questions (My apologies to those that
do not have interactive access.  I hope one day soon there will
be freenets in every large town.  Currently anyone in SC can go
to their local county agent & see a demo of internet & get an
interactive internet account for a price.):

TS> Could you please tell me how to do "whois".  I have been trying to find out
 the

 they
TS> don't give access to this to the other users on campus.  I don't know if
 this

TS>
TS> Thanks
TS> sallade@cerritos. edu    Toni Ann

telnet nic.ddn.mil
who will then be instructed to type WHOIS <return>
You will then get a prompt: Whois:
At the prompt try typing WHOIS AIR FORCE <return>
That will give you some addresses for the Air Force Academy about
which Jim Freed asked, below.  You will find nic.ddn.mil has some
toll free help lines.  (800) 365-3642 is the help desk in Chantilly,
Fairfax Co., VA.  If you call it now the answering machine says the
help desk is open 7AM to 7 PM EST M-F.  For you UUCP internet-
polling (non-interactive) people, I phoned one of the other 800
numbers (in Arlington, VA) and they said they think you can query
whois by email.  If you want to try that, phone the help desk when
it is open & ask them how.  I think whois is a protocol since I can
do whois -h waikato.ac.nz John & get all John's at Waikato U. in
Hamilton, NZ.  Since it is not just the milnet's whois, sited above,
you may have a whois on your machine that is different from the
above whois & may have to telnet as described above to get around
your machine's whois.

I would think there is NO OTHER NAME for gopher.  The question
"What is Gopher" should be answered best by running gopher.  Do
the following: telnet 141.211.190.102
then follow instructions & write me if this doesn't work.  You
do not need to telnet if you have a gopher server/client on your
machine.  If you type GOPHER and hit <enter> & your machine does
not understand, then you will have to telnet.  If one has not
tried gopher, I sure think they ought to take 5 minutes to see
gopher gopher from one machine to another to another, ad
infinitum.  I understand gopher has its on protocol (gopher
protocol) just as email is ip & tp (as in IP numbers) & just as
there is finger protocol to finger a distant computer.  I
understand UUCP is yet another protocol, ftp is another protocol
& I think I am leaving out a lot of protocols.

JF> Jim Freed   jmfreed@cc.owu.edu

Does anyone have a list of the internet names for universities?
WHOIS should take care of your question about the Air Force Academy.

As to the relevance of posting this on the ROOTS-LIST, it seems to
me that we on this LIST are doing genealogy on the LIST by the
"letter-writing" method (as opposed to doing research in the primary
sources themselves).  (I am sure that part of you spend part of your
days doing research in the primary sources (manuscripts in archives
or on film), but when on the board we are in the letter-writing mode
& thus whois and gopher may help us contact others with the surnames
of our interest.)  I believe Cliff is an expert on these things.  I
am just a novice user, but these are just a few of the fantastic
facilities here on the internet & I am so impressed I wanted to share
these few.  A lot more internet address hunting methods are known, but
why overload this letter.  I apologize for its length.  It just
occurred to me others may have posted answers to these.  I am not
subscribed to Roots-L since I'm subscribed to Lines-L & I just ftp the
Roots-L log when I want to read roots-L.  The soc.roots here is very
far behind.

WE spend a great deal of time trying to tease out information about
relatives long dead. Here is a posting from RISKS FORUM DIGEST about how
easy it is today to get data on the living...

Date: Wed, 23 Dec 92 12:28:17 EST
From: Brian Seborg <seborg@first.org>
Subject: What about "little brother?"

In the past we have tried to control information collected by "Big
Brother" or the Federal Government.  I believe that this has for the most
part been accomplished.  What has not been done, and what seriously needs
to be addressed is the collection and dissemination of information by
numerous "Little Brothers." Specifically, additional guidance is needed to
protect information maintained by credit reporting agencies, State
Government agencies, retail stores, and other entities which routinely
collect information that can be linked to an individual by name or other
unique identifier.

Since I teach a computer security class at a local college, the issue of
privacy seems even more important once you know how many ways the
information can be compromised.  After a lecture on privacy one of my
students mentioned that he worked with some private investigators, and he
mentioned that they routinely had access to all kinds of information on
people, and that agencies such as the state department of motor vehicles
routinely sold access to their records to just about anyone.

To illustrate the problem I asked the student to initiate an inquiry and
to see what he could find out with only my name as information.  The next
class he brought me the results of his spending about 30 minutes at a
computer terminal.  Here is a partial list of what he provided me in
printed form: my current address, the addresses of all my previous
residences, a list of all of the automobiles I have ever owned, my social
security number, my drivers license number, a list of all of the credit
cards I have ever owned including cancelled cards, their credit limits,
the credit card numbers, and the current balance, the name and address of
my employer, my father and brother's name and address, the name of my
wife, the name address and phone numbers of all of my neighbors, their
date of residence, and the type of home they had, my criminal record
(blank) along with any pending cases, my traffic record (not blank
unfortunately! :-)), my race, my income, the amount of my mortgage, my
credit rating, etc.  I imagine that most people have no idea that such
information about them is so easily accessible.  Imagine the potential for
coming up with a detailed profile of a person once you begin associating
individuals to the groceries they buy if the current trend of using check
cashing cards or bank-cards to pay for groceries really catches on!  For
example, could you imagine who might want to have access to lists of
customers which bought specific products?  Giant supermarkets (a large
chain in our area) already has the computer printing out coupons based on
the purchases you have made, what would they do with this information if
they could associate you with the groceries you bought?  One could imagine
the following phone call after purchasing a bladder control product: "Yes,
Mr.  Seborg, this is the office of Dr.  Nosey, Urologist, we are offering
five dollars off your initial consultation, when can we schedule you for
your first appointment?" Or worse, you could have someone inferring some
personal profile based on your patterns of consumption.  Far fetched,
maybe, but I bet you may think before you use that bank card, or check
cashing card next time at the grocery store, eh?

	It is on my list of things to do to create a new VMSINSTALable version
of GCC, but we had a disk die over the Christmas period, and until we get a
replacement I cannot do this.  I hope to get a new disk drive next week
sometime, and I may be able to put together save sets after that.  I intend to
put them on mango when I am through.

People who come into contact with the VAX/VMS system are often told,
"If you have trouble, see so-and-so, he's a guru", or "Bob there is

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  0 SPECIAL NOTE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are going to be at all serious about the 3B2, and especially if
you are relying on yourself for maintenance, the first thing you want
to do is obtain the AT&T 3B2 Computer Maintenance Manual.

It contains diagrams of all 3B2 computers up to the 3B2/600, parts
lists, breakdown procedures, troubleshooting information, and sources
of additional documentation.

In addition, it contains the "3B2 Computer Maintenance Utilities"
diskette called "idtools" (formerly known as "devtools").  This floppy
is bootable, and once running, the following options are available:

        > format floppy diskettes
        > format hard disk drives
        > verifies hard disk format
        > disk-to-disk high speed copies
        > disk-to-disk copy by sectors
        > disk-to-memory copies
        > defect table builder
        > writes sanity track
        > change default boot information

While some of these options are also available from UNIX, all the
utilities here can be run on a machine with a damaged (or missing) hard
disk, often allowing the drive to be repaired that is otherwise
unbootable.

This manual and disk can be ordered from the AT&T Customer Information
Center in Indianapolis, IN.  It has select code 305-395, and at press
time it sold for about $125.  The AT&T CuIC can be reached at:

	(800) 432-6600	Continental US
	(317) 322-6556	elsewhere

The CuIC takes phone orders with a credit card, and with a purchase
order for qualifying companies.  They have many other UNIX-related
books as well, so be sure to ask for their free "AT&T Documentation
Guide", select code 000-011.

Title:  Disk Expansion on the 3B2

[Edited by Gregory Gulik]

 Introduction
 ------------

The 3B2/400 family (/300, /310 and /400) computers use standard MFM
disk drives, and it is possible to add or replace these drives yourself
-- in this article we show you how to do this.

The 3B2/500 and larger machines all have SCSI (Small Computer Systems
Interface) disk drives, so these instructions do not apply to them.
For the duration of this article, "3B2" means the 3B2/400 and below,
and in the case where there are differences among these included models
we will mention them.

Before doing any drive replacement, you must obtain the _3B2 Computer
Maintenance Reference Manual_ from AT&T.  This document contains quite
a bit of useful information about your 3B2 hardware, and it is helpful
in its own right.  What makes it so special is the "idtools" diskette
that comes with it.  This floppy disk contains numerous utilities that
will help you diagnose and troubleshoot your computer, as well as the
disk formatting tools we need for our expansion project.

 What we don't tell you
 ----------------------

This is a fairly technical topic, and it relies on substantial
knowledge of UNIX system administration.  Those steps directly related
to the formatting operation are covered here, but others such as backup
and restore from tape, disk space allocation, and rebooting the machine
are prerequisite knowledge.  AT&T's sysadm documentation covers a great
deal of it, but if these things are new to you, perhaps you're not
ready to give this a go just yet.

Please keep in mind that if this is not done correctly (especially the
backups), you could lost most or all of your computer's data in a very
short time.  You must have at least one full, verified backup of all
filesystems, with _two_ backups being safer.  In addition, it is a good
idea to try this during an off time when you can afford to be down for
while if things don't go so well.

Finally, we have tried to present this information as accurately and
clearly as we can, but we cannot guarantee that there are no bugs.
Check everything, verify steps with the manual, and ask a local wizard
if you get stuck.  Of course, you undertake this procedure at your own
risk.

 Selecting a drive
 -----------------

There are many drives on the market that are satisfactory, and we
present some guidelines here for selecting one.  We have our favorites,
but most available ST-506 drives can be used in the 3B2.  Note that
these are suggestions only, not endorsements or guarantees of
compatibility.

The first restriction is that the idtools software will not format more
than 1024 cylinders in a single drive, and a drive with more will
simply have the excess cylinders ignored.  This is an unfortunate but
unavoidable waste of disk space, giving us a practical limit of about
135Mbyte.  (15 heads x 1024 cyls x 18 blks/track x 512 bytes/block).

Most of the drives found in the original 3B2 are made by Control Data
(or their subsidiary, Imprimis), and these Wren II drives are of
excellent quality, and they represent a very safe route.  These drives
are available with formatted capacities of 30 and 72 megabytes, and
they have an average access time of about 28 msec.  Other brands known
to work include Maxtor, Miniscribe, Priam, Micropolis and others.  Some
of these drives have more than 1024 cylinders which allows them to be
used, but at less than their advertised capacity.

 Disk types and the Equipped Device Table
 ----------------------------------------

Each drive in the 3B2 is formatted with a _disk type_, which is a small
number that identifies the drive to the machine.  The disk type indexes
into a table of drive information, and this table is part of the
/dgn/edt_data file.  This file is used to fill the Equipped Device
Table, a list of currently-available hardware devices maintained by the
firmware.  Part of this list, the _subdevice table_, describes the
possible hard disk drives.

 Getting started
 ---------------

Now that the formatting tools have arrived and a drive has been
obtained, we are ready to do the installation.  It is at this point
that a full backup of the entire system is in order and to review the
relevant portions of the Maintenance Manual.

After backing up the current drives, shut down the machine, turn off
the power, and remove the power plug.  Open the case, note the current
configuration of the drive cables, and remove them along with the power
connectors.

Select "drive 0" on the drive select jumpers, insert/enable the
terminating resistor, and place the drive back in the cage.  Connect
drive zero's data cable (the thin ribbon cable), the last connector on
the wide control cable, and the power cable to the rear of the drive.
Pay particular attention to pin one orientation, and insure that all
connections are snug.

At this point you are ready to turn on the machine.  Plug in the 3B2
power cable and turn the switch to "ON".  The console should show a
SELF CHECK, followed shortly by

	FW ERROR 1-02: DISK SANITY FAILURE
		       EXECUTION HALTED

	SYSTEM FAILURE: CONSULT YOUR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION UTILITIES GUIDE

This ominous message is actually expected, and it just means that the
disk drive is not formatted yet.  At this point, type your current
firmware password (usually "mcp") followed by RETURN, and you will be
presented with the normal firmware menu.

At this point you should boot "/idtools" from the floppy drive (load
device 0, FD5).  Once booted, idtools displays an informational message
and asks that RETURN be hit.

Note that this entire process is covered in Appendix B of the
Maintenance Reference Manual, and we strongly recommend that you review
sections

	Hard Disk Formatter (B-8),
	Defect Table Builder (B-33), and
	Writing Sanity Track (B-47)

plus the introduction before continuing.

 Running Idtools
 ---------------

At the first menu, "formhard" should be entered.  It will ask which disk
should be formatted, and the proper response is zero in most cases.  If
you are doing this procedure on a machine with two drives installed, be
_very_ careful when answering this question.

Next, you are asked for drive configuration information.  You must
enter the drive type (from a previous section) plus the drive
dimensions, and the following table summarizes several models we know
about.  If your drive is not shown, consult your vendor documentation
for this information.

Drive type	drv id	cyls trk/cyl sec/trk byte/cyl     abbrev
--------------- ------	---- ------- ------- --------	  ------
Wren II 30MB	   3     697	 5	18	512       HD30
Wren II 72MB	   5	 925	 9	18	512       HD72
Fujitsu M2243AS	   8     754    11      18      512       HD72C
Micropolis 1325    5    1024     8      18      512       HD72
Maxtor 1140	   4*	 918=	15	18	512       HD120
Maxtor 1190	  11	1224+   15	18	512       HD135
Miniscribe XXXX    4*
Priam XXXX

* selected by user
+ can only use 1024 cylinders on this drive
= can usually be formatted out to 1024 cylinders, even though it is
  actually capable of 1224 cylinders, like the 1190.

Note that "tracks/cylinder" means "heads", and the sectors/track and
bytes/cylinder values the same for all drives.  The drive ID is shown
as 4 for high-capacity drives, and it assumes that this number was
inserted into the Equipped Device Table subdevice listing.

In the following examples, user responses are in *bold*, and the drive
shown is a Maxtor 1140.  Note that the default entries shown may vary
from machine to machine.

	Format which disk [ 0 or 1 ] (0)?  *0*

	Drive id: 3- ? *4*
	Number of cylinders: 687 - ?  *918*
	Numbers tracks/cyl: 5 - ?  *15*
	Number sectors/track: 18 - ? *18*
	Number bytes/sector: 512 - ? *512*

Once these values have been entered, idtools shows where it will place
various housekeeping areas on the disk, almost all stored on the first
two cylinders.  You need not concern yourself with the specific values
printed.

 Defect Mapping
 --------------

The bad block listing (with various alternate names, such as "Flag
Track Log") is usually found on a sticker on top of the drive.  To
simplify data entry, it is a good idea to photocopy this sticker while
it is on the drive, because later the drive might not be in such a
comfortable reading position (especially if it is in a drive cage).

The first prompt in this section asks if the backup defect table should
be modified.  A formatted drive normally has two copies of the defect
table on disk in case one is lost, but a blank drive has no such
table.  Answering "yes" to this question means that the data you enter
here is stored in both places.

To enter the defects, enter "new" when asked, then "bc" for the type of
defect byte count.  Then, for each bad sector, enter the cylinder
number, the head number, and the byte count, all separated by spaces.
This "byte count" field is often shown on the disk label as "BFIND"
(bytes from index) or "BCAI" (byte count after index), and it is
distinct from the sector number.  Most entries have a block length of
one, but if the label shows more than this then it must be the fourth
field on the line.

An entry of "q" terminates the input, and displays the entire list of
blocks entered.  It is vital that this list be checked completely, and
edits made if necessary.  An entry of just a RETURN accepts the current
list and moves onto the next prompt.

		       Format entire disk - type 1
		      Format single track - type 2
	Format from selected track to end - type 3

	Select type of format [1, 2, or 3] (1) ?

Entering "1" followed by RETURN starts the formatting process, and when
it completes it starts a verify pass where all blocks on the disk are
examined for errors.  This operation can take some time on a large
drive, and idtools shows its progress with a message displayed every
five cylinders formatted.

After the format and verify, idtools writes the "sanity track" with the
"fixdisk" program.  The sanity track contains a special data pattern
that validates the drive to the 3B2, and it takes just a moment and
requires no input from you.

With the conclusion of the fixdisk operation the drive is formatted.
You can remove the idtools floppy and power the machine down.

 Closing up the machine
 ----------------------

The machine should now be put back together and the original drives
reinstalled.  It is important that all drive selects and terminating
resistors be installed properly, following the rules mentioned
previously.

The first drive in the machine has the lowest drive select jumper
(usually position zero) and connected to the zero data cable (usually
the bottom drive).  The second drive in the machine has the next drive
select (usually position one) and the other data cable, and the control
cable connects them both.  The drive that is at the physical end of the
control cable must have the terminating resistor.

Disk drives installed into an XM expansion module have special rules on
termination, and these are documented and diagramed on pages 6-23 and
6-24 of the Maintenance Reference Manual.

 Partitioning the drive
 ----------------------

The easiest case is adding a second drive to a machine that previously
had only one.  After installing the new unit, boot /unix from the hard
drive and enter single-user mode (this is much easier if you have
edited /etc/inittab).

With the /usr partition mounted, run the "sysadm" command, and at each
successive menu, enter "diskmgmt", "harddisk", and "partitioning" in
turn.  This enters the partitioning operation and it should prompt you
for the relevant information.  We do not discuss strategies for
allocating filesystem resources, as this is covered in the AT&T system
administrative documentation.

Once the drive is partitioned, the added filesystems (say, /usr2 and
/usr3) may be used immediately.

All other cases involve replacing existing drives, and it most
expedient to use the full restore procedure for this.  A full backup is
absolutely required here for this operation, and it should be verified
once it is made.

Boot the "Essential Utilities - Disk 1" floppy and select the "Full
Restore" operation.  This procedure includes a partitioning step that
allows you to allocate your new disk resources.  Follow the
instructions shown on the screen.

After the core set of floppies -- five or six disks -- you can
interrupt this process, boot /unix from the hard disk, and restore all
of your backups.  You may have to install the Cartridge Tape Utilities
if your backups are stored on that medium.

WARNING: This "full restore" operation destroys all data on all hard
disks during the partitioning, and you _must_ have a full set of
reliable, verified backups before considering this step, and two full
sets of backups would not be a bad idea.  If these backups are not done
properly, all data on the disks will be LOST.  Please be very careful
when doing this, as mistakes can be costly.

 Compatibility note
 ------------------

Some early models of the 3B2/300 do not permit a 72MB hard drive to be
added to the system board.  The recognizing signs for this restriction
are documented in the Maintenance Reference Manual on page 7-21, and
3B2/300 owners should consult this information before starting this
project.

While the documentation does not mention the reason for this
restriction, we speculate that any drive with more than eight heads
cannot be used in these older machines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  2 How do I create a second swap partition?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the steps I used to add a second swap partition to my
3B2/400.  Why add a second  swap area?   By default, the SVR3.1
system disks (the version I use) make one swap area of 10196 blocks
on the first hard disk (/dev/rdsk/c1d0s1).  While this 5Mb area
seems plenty for most uses, I managed to exhaust it.  It was time to
RTFM.  While the manual gives you the confidence to say that you *can*
increase the number of swap partitions, it doesn't clearly tell you
exactly how to go about doing that.  What follows are the steps you
can follow to add another swap partition to your system.

Are you adding this swap space "just to balance the load"?  If so,
forget it.  The effect is negligible and clearly not worth the effort.
I have been unsuccessful in conclusively proving whether or not SVR3.1
does perform balanced allocation of the swap space.  It seems to knock
a huge chunk off the first partition before it even touches the second
one.  I would not think of doing this unless you have SVR3.1 or
SVR3.2.  Earlier versions do not have the advanced swap handling
functions, and may not even allow you to do this.  Upgrade time.
The only reason to add another swap partition is if you have a valid
reason to do so (i.e. you have exhausted your present swap space).
Remember that swap cannot be used for anything else, you take space
away from your mountable filesystems when you add swap space.

Please keep in mind that this is *your* system, and these steps can
easily wipe out all your data files.  Take adequate care to back
up your data.  Make sure your backups work before you start any of this.

IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU HAVE A PAPER COPY OF THESE
DIRECTIONS IN FRONT OF YOU AS YOU PERFORM THIS TASK.

Step 0: BACK UP THE SYSTEM!  I cannot stress this enough.
        If you have a tape drive, use that in preference over the
	floppy drive.  Back up the /, /usr, and /usr2 partitions.
	While it is not mandatory, it's also a good idea to back up
	everything else just in case catastrophe strikes.  Expect the
	worst and hope for the best.

Step 1: Reload the Foundation floppies and select a custom partition
        setup.  Pick the sizes you want for the new swap partitions.
	Since you are adding a second swap partition, it is up to you
	if you wish to add to (or keep) the original 5Mb swap
	partition.  It is mandatory that you keep *some* swap space on
	the first disk.  There is no rule that says the 2 partitions must
	be equal in size.  Finish the full restore.

	For Your Information: the sizes of the partitions are
	dependent on the number of blocks per cylinder group.  That
	means, you can specify size in units of (18 * number of
	heads).  If you specify a number that is not a round figure,
	the machine will round it for you.  RECORD THIS NUMBER!!!
	This new partition will be named /usrX (where X is a positive
	integer) and there will be a filesystem made upon it.  Do not worry.

Step 2: Bring up unix, log in as root, and bring the machine to runlevel 1.
        When the machine is in single-user mode, make sure that all
	disk partitions are unmounted (except for the root partition!)

Step 3: Make a temporary file with the existing partition data:

        # prtvtoc /dev/rdsk/c1d1s6 > /tmp/disk.data

Step 4: Edit the disk.data file.  Make the following changes:
        change the tag field from 0 to 3 (from 'user' to 'swap')
        change the flags from 00 to 01 (unmountable partition)
        delete all the initial comments (lines with initial *'s)
	Double check this file to make sure you got it right

Step 5: Save this data back to the hard disk.  If you choose to chicken
        out, do it BEFORE THIS STEP:

        # fmthard -s /tmp/disk.data /dev/rdsk/c1d1s6

Step 6: Edit /etc/fstab to remove the reference to the now defunct
        filesystem.  You don't have to do anything else to the actual
	partition to remove the filesystem - the system will page over
	the superblock and inode lists by itself.

Step 7: Use /etc/swap to tell the system that the partition is ready
        for paging/swapping.  The best way to do this is to make the
	system add this partition each time it boots.  Create a file
	called /etc/rc2.d/S00SETSWAP.  Link it to the file
	/etc/init.d/S00SETSWAP.  In this file, add the following line:

	/etc/swap -a /dev/dsk/c1d1sYY 0 XXXXX

	In this case, the Y's in the disk name should be set to the
	disk partition that the new swap space is to be located on.
	Usually, this is partition 8 (if you specified the swap space
	as the first partition on the disk before /usr).  The 0 (zero)
	signifies that swap activity is to start at the 0th block of
	the partition - the start.  Replace the XXXXX with the number
	of blocks available in the partition.  This is the number you
	recorded in Step 1 above.

Step 8: Reboot and pray.  If it all went well, the machine will come
        up in multi-user mode.  Once again, log in as root and bring
	the machine down to single-user state.  Make sure that the
	system is actually using the new partition with the

	# /etc/swap -l

	command.  You should see the original swap partition
	(/dev/dsk/c1d0s1) as well as your new partition listed.

	If your machine did not boot for some bizarre reason, reload
	the system again (go to step 1), making sure that you do
	everything correctly.

Step 9: Restore your data.  If you backed up on floppy, just restore
        them in order and reboot.  If you backed up on a CTC tape drive,
        you must install the Cartridge Tape Utilities disk, reboot,
        recover your data, and reboot one last time.  IF you didn't back
        up your data, then you're SOL.

        A note to those with XDC and SCSI drives - the maneuvers you
        have just completed only messed up the data on the 2 internal
        disk drives.  Any data on your 3rd (and higher) drives should
        remain untouched.

There is another way to do this whole thing without reloading the
entire OS.  It involves having a boot floppy with prtvtoc, fmthard,
swap, and a few other files on it.  You would have to make this before
hand (explained in a different question).  In this instance, you would
only alter the partitions on the disk you added the new partition to.
This, however, would force you to re-create and restore filesystems on the
partition(s) you borrowed space from.  For my time and money, it was
easier (and less error-prone) to add the swap partition by reloading
the Foundation disks.  True Blue Gurus (TM) can experiment with the
second method.

Comments and criticisms welcome.

Subject:  3 How can I get X11 for the 3B2?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: aj4640@dean1.usma.edu  Robertson John MAJ at US Military Academy, West
Point, N

[Read the P.S. at the end of this message before attempting to
 ftp these files.]

The X11 R4 distribution tape contains sources to run clients on a 3b1.
Several of us have hacked those sources to enable clients to run on a
3b2.

I wish I could offer the source patches directly but for various
reasons, I can't.  However, 3b2 users are more than welcome to have the
clients, the libraries, the include files, and the pre-processor.  This
will get X-windows up on your 3b2 without the xdaemon stuff (as long as
you have the Wollongong networking stuff.)  With this stuff, you'll
have a pile of ready-to-run clients as well as the tools needed to
compile your own X11 applications.

In addition to the default X11 R4 clients, bin.tar.Z also has a running
copy of tgif, xdvi, xmahjongg [you'll need to do the fonts for your
server.  UTSL!], and lots of other neat stuff.

The lib.tar.Z contains libX11.a, libXt.a, etc.  In addition, the
app-defaults for all the clients in bin.tar.Z are also here.

include.tar.Z has all the include files.  You'll need these if you want
to compile your own stuff.

cpp.tar.Z is a compiled version of the X11 distribution preprocessor.
In this version, you'll need to define the symbol 3b2 before
invocation.  It will not gag on the big header files that many X
applications use.

The files can be obtained via anonymous ftp from euler.math.usma.edu.
They are in pub/3b2.  Other than unpaccking and installing the clients
and lib stuff in the usual places, no other special work should be
needed.

I cannot offer any support for this stuff.  Take it, hack it, and have
fun.  Even more, give the clients away to other suffering 3b2 users.
It has made our 3b2's substantially easier to use.

Jack

P.S.  The X11R4 clients for the 3B2 have been moved to Bradley University
      on erratic.bradley.edu in pub/3B2_X.  If that system is down, you
      may want to also try ds3.bradley.edu, also in pub/3B2_X.

Subject:  4 How do I install a non AT&T SCSI drive on my 3B2?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: geoff@ugc.uucp (Geoff Coleman)

Installation of Third Party SCSI drive on AT&T 3B2

1.  Hardware Addition
The hardware installation is relatively simple. The SCSI address of the
disk must be set via jumpers. If the disk being added is the first
outside disk for the 3B2 then the you must use an "AT&T SCSI Connect
Kit".

2.  Telling the system about the disk
After the disk has been physically attached the machine should be
restarted.  If the disk is one that is unknown to the 3B2 a message
will appear on the console that there is an unknown scsi device "make"
"model". The make and model information is important.

Once the 3b2 is rebooted login as root and cd to /etc/scsi.  At this
point you should run ./edittbl -l to list all of the SCSI devices known
to the system. Then run device table. The first entry is the make and
must be padded with spaces to 8 characters.  The second entry is the
model and must be padded to 16 characters with spaces.  The number of
lu's is one unless it is a bridge controller.

At this point you should reboot the machine and there should be no
unknown device error message on bootup.

3.  Formatting the disk
Once the system has been rebooted login as root and change the run
level to single user mode and remount /usr if need be.

At this point you need to cd to /usr/lib/scsi and edit the file
tc.index.  Add an entry for the new disk in the same manner as the
other entries in this file. Make sure that the model number starts in
column 9 and is padded out to 16 characters, if you receive an unable
to open script file message on formatting the problem is most likely in
this entry.

At this point you can run the format program from either sysadm or the
command line. After the format has finished reboot the system and the
disk should be listed as a formatted disk.

Subject:  5 How do I prevent data overrun errors when using a high
            speed modem on an EPORTS card at 19.2K baud or higher?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The EPORTS board can easily handle 38.4K baud on an otherwise
unloaded system, provided Hardware Flow Control is enabled.  The
hard part is keeping HFC enabled.  Several solutions to this problem
exist, but one that seems to work (and I use personally) is to have
a daemon set HFC on open lines periodically, and have uugetty enable
HFC on all logins.

The second part is the trickier part.  Elliot Dierksen suggests
the following, which I have verified to work:

From: ebd@fang.att.com (Elliot B Dierksen)

Step 1: copy uugetty to some new name (I used epuugetty). Use some
sort of binary editor to change the exec of '/bin/login' to '/bin/ephfc'.

Step 2: compile ephfc. Here it is!

I have had no problems with this at all, but your mileage may vary.
No promises implied or intended. Even with cron entries to set HFC,
I still have problems on occasion with dial outs. Inbound calls
work great.

I hope you all find this useful!

It means more files being opened than the limit you've set for the

NINODE & NS5INODE (or something close to that), then cd /boot,
mkboot -k KERNEL, touch /etc/system then reboot the system.

Subject: Anonymous ftp with WIN/TCP 3.0.x YES!!

Contrary to the documentation for WIN/TCP 3.0.{0,1}, it is possible to
set up anonymous ftp.  The Bugs: note in the documentation about it not
being fully implemented in this release seems to be just a
documentation omission.  I saw the method to use on a US military 3B2
Users Group mailing list.  The missing parts are the creation of a dev
directory in the root of the ftp account directory with null and tcp
devices created with mknod, and the inclusion of the services file in
the etc subdir along with group and passwd files.  You of course need
ls & pwd in bin and a pub tree.  Below is the output of ls -lR in my
ftp root as well as the passwd in ~ftp/etc/passwd.  Try it out and

A special note from Steven M. Kilby <skilby@ucqais.cba.uc.edu>

Anonymous FTP for the 400:
    Setting up an anonymous FTP login for the 3B2/400 differs slightly from
the instructions in the FAQ.  The FAQ instructions will work on 600's or
1000's.  The only changes are in the directory setup.

[As other people found the original anonymous FTP setup did not
 work at all without Steven M. Kilby's changes, I modified the
 directory structure above to reflect Steve's changes.  -greg]

Also:
From: Kevin Darcy <kevin@cfctech.cfc.com>

Also, you should probably make people aware that the exact minor
numbers for all clone devices will vary from system to system, and
to only use the ones displayed as a guide. For instance, my dev
entries for circ, tcp & udp are

crw-rw-rw-   1 root     other     63, 66 Sep 10  1991 /dev/circ
crw-rw-rw-   1 root     other     63, 56 Sep 10  1991 /dev/tcp
crw-rw-rw-   1 root     other     63, 58 Sep 10  1991 /dev/udp

which is somewhat different than what's shown above (cfctech's
major numbers are higher than most folks', because we have run
StarLAN, Datakit & WIN/TCP all simultaneously on the machine, in
addition to everything on the release tape, and, at one point, even
loaded X Windows on the box (!)).

Subject:  9 How do I run Unix from floppy (for example, to repair a damage
	    hard drive file system)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

               Running a Standalone Shell on a 3B2

                        Stephen J. Friedl
                    [Edited by Gregory Gulik]

                         April 25, 1988

          NB:  the   procedures   described   here
          require  substantial  knowledge  of  UNIX and
          entail a significant risk of causing loss  of
          data.  The obvious disclaimers apply here, so
          use at your own risk.  Please be careful.

Introduction

     This document is an introduction to operating your 3B from a
standalone /unix.  Even with inoperable hard drives, it is possible to
insert the boot floppy (Essential Utilities Disk 1), say some magic
words, and receive a # prompt.  At this point you can do major surgery
on the failing machine, often recovering a drive previously thought to
be lost.

     Our style is informal and we'll use lots of examples to illustrate
the points at hand.  We have been using standalone shells for quite
some time and have learned a great deal; we hope to pass this
information on to you.  Please read this document carefully before
trying the methods described here, and if possible have a wizard around
when giving it a go.  This can be dangerous business: as has been said
before, it is a time where experience and informed courage count for
much.

Conventions

     Throughout this document, sample usage sessions will be shown
indented, with user input in bold.  To make it easier to distinguish
between a multiuser UNIX shell and a standalone one, we will show
multiuser UNIX's root prompt as ## and the standalone prompt as #.


>>> Back up your boot disks b->

     This cannot be emphasized enough.  Your boot floppies are the key
to your machine, and without them the machine is down.

Why do you want a standalone /unix?

     The most compelling reason for a standalone shell is when the
primary drive has gone down and must be recovered.  While working from
a standalone /unix is slow and tedious, it can often save an entire
hard disk with minimal data loss.

     We have also used this standalone shell to repair a corrupt
/etc/inittab, to fix /etc/passwd, to restore a /bin/login that had been
removed, and to install new bootstraps on the hard drive.  With a
standalone boot disk in hand, a host of possibilities presents itself.


What is on your boot disk?

     Before booting this floppy, take some time to explore its
contents, as the disk has a filesystem on it that can be mounted and
perused.  To do this, insert a COPY of the Essential Utilities Floppy 1
(from now on, "the boot floppy") into the drive with a write-protect
tab.  Now,

          ## mount /dev/dsk/c0d0s5 /install -r

     Because boot floppies vary from release to release, it would be
most helpful to simply get a listing of the contents of your particular
boot floppy.

     Once finished, the floppy must be unmounted:

          ## cd /
          ## umount /dev/dsk/c0d0s5

"Open Sesame"

     To give standalone a try, first shut the machine down to firmware
mode.  Assuming the machine is now in firmware mode, put a copy of the
boot disk into the drive.  Note that some versions of the operating
system (Sys V Release 2, at least) require that the boot floppy be
write-enabled (i.e., no write-protect tab); it is this requirement that
mandates multiple backups of the boot floppy.  UNIX will be updating
the disk while it runs -- the superblock, access times, etc. -- and if
the machine crashes at the wrong time it simply will not boot again
without an fsck.  Be careful.

     Type in your firmware password and boot /unix from the floppy
drive (Option 0, named `FD5') instead of the hard drive (Option 1,
named `HD30' or `HD72').  It can take several minutes for UNIX to boot,
but when it does, the familiar menu will be displayed:

               1) Full Restore
               2) Partial Restore
               3) Dual-Disk Upgrade
               4) Release Upgrade
               Selection? [1, 2, 3, 4, quit, help]

     At this point, type the phrase

                           magic mode

     The system recognizes this special option and responds:

          Poof!

          Selection? [1, 2, 3, 4, quit, help, shell, copy]

     Notice the new options?  Now type shell, then RETURN, and you will
be greeted with the familiar # prompt.  You are now running a
standalone shell on the floppy.

     A few reminders here: a floppy filesystem is not able to hold much
data, and many common utilities are unavailable.  When dealing with the
standalone shell, one must learn alternatives to these utilities.  For
example, echo * can replace ls(1), and cat > file can serve as a poor
replacement to ed(1).  One must become remarkably resourceful when
working in an environment as restricted as this.  We will see later how
we can enhance this confined environment with additional tools.

Standalone devices

     The floppy's /dev directory contains a host of entries, some of
them referring to partitions on the hard drive.  While a particular
partition may have several names, we generally use the following
devices to refer to the hard disk:

          Partition        What it is (on the hard disk)
          -----------      -----------------------------
          /dev/idsk00      / filesystem
          /dev/idsk01      swap area
          /dev/idsk02      /usr filesystem
          /dev/idsk06      the entire disk
          /dev/idsk07      boot partition
          /dev/idsk08      optional filesystem (/u or /usr2)

Mounting the hard drive

     To gain access to the primary hard drive, partitions of interest
are mounted onto directories on the floppy.  The device names are
selected from the table in the previous section.

     Before mounting a partition, we recommend running the filesystem
check fsck(1m) first.  The mount command will fail if the the
superblock is not in order -- this is often the case after a crash.  In
addition, it gives a convenient verification of the device status and
the the filesystem's name and volume.

          # /etc/fsck /dev/idsk00

     While some errors are to be expected while checking the root
partition, a total failure is a very serious error.  Our experience
defines "total failure" as an indication by fsck that it cannot find
any possible traces of a filesystem.  In particular, "CAN NOT READ: BLK
1" is one of the more ominous messages we have seen.

     Once fsck grants the filesystem a clean bill of health, it is
ready to be mounted.  Rather than take up space for a handful of common
commands, AT&T has rolled several of them into one:  fsys.  It is
undocumented and appears to only be used on the boot floppy.  Some
versions of the boot disk do contain the mount and umount programs and
those can be used instead of fsys.

     Fsys takes a handful of options, not all of which are interesting
to us in standalone mode.  Used in the install scripts for a handful of
filesystem-related duties, we will use it simply as a replacement for
mount(1m) and umount(1m).  To mount the hard disk's root filesystem
onto the floppy's /install directory, do:

          # fsys -m /install /dev/idsk00

     Fsys will complain on an error, and this brings us to a serious
bug in this program: if either the mount directory or the partition's
device name are invalid for any reason, the error message will always
point to the partition device name.  This can be, to put it lightly,
"misleading".

     With the hard drive's root filesystem mounted on /install, it is
now fully part of the standard directory tree.  While the floppy has no
editor or many of the helpful tools, the root partition does, and these
can be exploited.  When beginning an extended standalone session on the
primary drive, we have found it helpful to extend the shell's search
path:

          # PATH=/install/bin:/install/etc:$PATH ; export PATH

     Now the familiar ls, ed, (but not vi) and many other commands are
available.  Since they will be loaded from the hard drive, execution is
much faster.

     As an example, assume that the root password has been forgotten
and the machine is basically closed.  The solution suggested by AT&T's
documentation (in the System Administration Utilities Guide) is to do a
partial restore.  The difficulty with this approach is that many
important system files -- /etc/passwd, /etc/inittab, /etc/gettydefs,
and others -- are overwritten in the process.  Even with a full backup,
this can be an unpleasant undertaking.

     An alternate approach will use the standalone shell.  The general
strategy is to mount the hard drive, edit the password file, and boot
multiuser UNIX.  The full procedure is:

          (boot standalone /unix)
          # fsck /dev/idsk00
          # fsys -m /install /dev/idsk00
          # /install/bin/ed /install/etc/passwd
          (edit the file in the standard way)
          w
          q
          # fsys -u /dev/idsk00

     At this point, the root drive is now unmounted and the system may
be rebooted.  Normally you can just type exit at the shell prompt and
you will be returned to the monitor and asked what program to boot.  If
that doesn't work on your version, try:

          # sync
          # sync
          # /etc/uadmin 2 2

     Uadmin(1m) is documented in the manual (you must also refer to the
uadmin(2) manual page) -- the above does a normal return to the monitor
(i.e., firmware).  WARNING: uadmin(1m) is available from full UNIX as
well but is very dangerous.  Use it with extreme caution and only if
you really know what uadmin does.

Making a standalone boot disk

          ================== WARNING ==================
          Only do this on backup copies of  the  disks,
          NEVER to the main Essential Utilities Disk.
          ================== WARNING ==================

     The Essential Utilities Disk 1 contains many files needed by the
automatic restore/upgrade procedures, but for standalone work, many are
not needed.  After working with these disk for some time, we were able
to narrow down what is helpful to have on the disk and what is not.
The following procedure (run from multiuser mode, signified by the ##
prompt) will convert an Essential Utilities disk to a standalone boot
disk.

          (from hard disk UNIX)
          ## fsck /dev/dsk/c0d0s5
          ## mount /dev/dsk/c0d0s5 /install
          ## cd /install/inst/bin
          ## mv fsys pdinfo swap ttyset ../../bin
          ## cd /install
          ## /bin/rm -rf inst
          ## cp /bin/ed /install/bin
          ## cp /etc/fsdb /install/etc
          ## cat > /install/inittab
          is:s:initdefault:
          sh:s:respawn:/bin/sh < /dev/console > /dev/console 2>&1
          ^D
          ## cd /
          ## umount /dev/dsk/c0d0s5

     While there may be other files on this floppy that are not needed,
we have operated on the principle of least customization.  It has been
our experience that keeping the procedure simple allows it to be done
on-the-fly (say, at a customer site) and minimizes the exploration
required when a new operating system disk is released.

     In addition, it is not wise to pack the disk too tightly.  The
editor requires adequate space under /tmp, so an almost-full disk
precludes editing all but the smallest files; this applies whether the
file being edited resides on the hard drive or the floppy.

     Once this is done, the new disk will come up in standalone mode
without the need for magic mode.  In addition ed(1) and fsdb(1m) are
available.  The other tools mentioned (pdinfo, swap, ttyset) are
helpful but not required by the basic procedures.

     It has been our experience that any version (SVR2, SVR3) of boot
disk can be used with any version of hard disk UNIX without difficulty
for doing simple operations such a performing filesystem checks or
editing /etc/passwd.  For more complex operations, such as
repartitioning the hard drive or restoring the bootstraps, higher
version compatibility is required.

Security Considerations

     It should be apparent that knowledge of these standalone methods
is tremendously powerful.  In addition to being able to rescue a
foundering machine, an unrestricted path to root has been provided as
well.  While all the standard rules about physical security of the
computer apply here, an additional step may be taken to thwart a
would-be interloper.

     The responsible system administrator of a machine in a hostile
environment will generally change the computer's firmware password.
This magic word is required before the monitor on the 3B2 motherboard
will boot from a floppy, and lack of this password prevents a malicious
user from simply pulling the power plug to enter firmware mode.

     In addition to changing the firmware password, the floppy key
floppy should itself be secured.  When the computer is restarted with
this disk in the drive, it will clear the non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) and
restore the default parameters.  Because the firmware password is
included in these "default parameters", this disk should be kept out of
non-trusted hands.

Subject: 10 What is/was the 3B Journal?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The _3B Journal_ was put out sporadically by Owens-Laing
    Publications for several years in the late 1980s, and I used to be
    the technical editor.  The magazine dealt with the 3B1 and 3B2
    platforms, and the content varied from very markety-oriented to
    quite technical (the latter usually written by me).

    The publisher never seemed to get a handle on the business end of
    running a magazine, and I've heard nothing past the fourth quarter,
    1989 issue.  The current phones are disconnected, and I have NO
    information on subscriptions or anything like that.

Subject: 12 How do I build GCC on the 3B2?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

John L. Wehle ported GCC to the WE32000 series processor, and it
first appeared in release 2.2 of GCC.

To build the GCC 2.3.2 release on the 3B2, download the latest GCC
distribution and allocate at least 40 MB of disk space to do the
build.  Follow the directions in the INSTALL file.  The following
are some notes that will make the install go smoother.

If you are already using GCC 2.2.2, use that and follow the directions
exactly as listed in the INSTALL file.  It's by far the easiest
way to go.

First of all, older versions of /lib/cpp are not capable of
processing one of the source files.  I recommend building the
distribution until the GNU cpp is done.  Then, temporarily replace
your /lib/cpp with the GNU version, and add the following flag to
CFLAGS:

CFLAGS = -U__STDC__

When stage1 is complete, you could remove the -U__STDC__ flag
and restore your original cpp.

Basically, the steps are as follows:

	$ configure --target=3b2
	$ make LANGUAGES=c
	$ make stage1
	$ make LANGUAGES=c CC=stage1/gcc CFLAGS="-Bstage1/ -g"

[It is important to note that due to a bug in the AT&T compiler,
 the optimizer doesn't get compiled correctly at this point.]

	$ make stage2
	$ make CC=stage2/gcc CFLAGS="-Bstage2/ -g -O"

[Some people still have problems with the optimizer at this point.
 If you do, just do not use the -O flag when compiling GCC.  The
 symptom you will experience that tells you the -O flag should be
 removed is the compilation of cccp.c will take a VERY long time.
 Kill the compile and restart without the -O.]

	$ make stage3
	$ make CC=stage3/gcc CFLAGS="-Bstage3/ -g -O"

To verify everything built correctly:

	$ for file in *.o; do
	> tail +10c $file > foo1
	> tail +10c stage3/$file > foo2
	> cmp foo1 foo2 || echo $file
	> done

Then, to install the distribution:

	$ make CC=stage3/gcc CFLAGS="-Bstage3/ -g -O" install

Good luck!

[These notes are a combination of my own experiences with building the
 GCC compiler on a 3B2/400 and discussions with John Wehle, the author
 of the port.]

NOTES:

The GCC binaries available on several anonymous FTP sites will not
work with certain version of the standard C compiler.  It appears
to be some sort of linker problem.  I may have a fix for it.
Contact me via E-mail if you fall into this category.

Speaking of linker problems, GCC 2.2.2 will not work all that well with
the standard C shared library -lc_s.  The workaround for this is
to compile your program with GCC, but the link will fail.  When it
does, use something like the following to do the link stage:

$ cc -O -L/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/we32k-att-sysv/2.2.2 program.o \
	-o program -lgcc -lc_s

This way, you will not only get fast binaries, but small ones as
well.  This problem has been corrected in 2.3.2 (Thanks Stallman!)

You may need to raise your ULIMIT to compile the g++ compiler as
the executable is larger than 1 MB.

Subject: 13 What is the NVRAM SANITY FAILURE?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The full error message resembles the following:

FW ERROR 1-01: NVRAM SANITY FAILURE
               DEFAULT VALUES ASSUMED
               IF REPEATED, CHECK THE BATTERY

The 3B2 stores information such as the time of day clock and machine
name in non-volatile memory.  The memory is backed up by a Lithium
battery, that does die after a few years.  The battery is normally
located in the right side of the case, near the cards, and connected to
the motherboard under the card in slot 2.  Replacing the battery almost
always requires the complete removal of the card cage.  Replacement
batteries can be found at some electronics stores.  I won't list exact
specifications because I have seen 3 different types of batteries so
far, and there may be more.  Your best bet is to just buy another
batter with the exact same voltage and modify the connector to fit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 14 Is there an implementation of SLIP for the 3B2?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rumor has it that there was one written by Wollongong, but AT&T
purchased exclusive marketing rights to WIN TCP/IP for the 3B2, but
chose NOT to include SLIP.  There is the NOS (KA9Q) package that
supposedly provides SLIP capabilities, but I have not tried it and
don't know if it'll run on a 3B2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 15 What are the known bugs in the Wollongong WIN TCP software?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Steven M. Kilby <skilby@ucqais.cba.uc.edu>

rexecd:
    The rexecd released with WIN TCP for the 3B2 has the following bug.
This bug has been verified on a 400 with TCP 3.0.1 and 3.2.  When executing
a command using the rexecd daemon, the gid of the user is set and left at
root.  This is very apparent when executing a command that creates a shell,
such as XTerm.  The only available solutions at present are to rewrite the
daemon yourself, or.... not run it.  The problem has been reported to CERT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 16 Is there an implementation of NFS for the 3B2?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The person to contact about 3B2 software is Kristine Schneider
[708-979-1017].  I called her and obtained the following information
about NFS:

Latest Versions:        1.3
Requires:               System V Rel 3.2.1 or 3.2.3, WIN/TCP 3.2 or higher
Product Code:           C274-0NB3-000
List Price:             $1295.00

This package is for the WE versions of the 3B2.  NFS comes bundled with
SVR4 for RISC-based 3B2's.  TCP/IP on the other hand, does not and has
to be purchased separately.

Subject: 17 What are the pinouts of those phone-like serial connectors?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The connectors 3B2's use are called RJ-45.  They are 8 conductor
telephone like connectors, and lucky for us, are pretty standard.
You can either buy the cables and connectors from AT&T for an arm
and a leg, or elsewhere.  I don't know about the cables, since I've
never bought them from anyone but AT&T, but I have made my own
RS-232 connectors with excellent results.

The following is an excellent description of the RJ-45 port on the
3B2:

From: rthomas@hakatac.almanac.bc.ca (Robert N Thomas)

Looking into the 8 pin modular RJ-45 jack you'll see that pin 1
should be on the right.

	Diagram of what you should see when looking
	at an 8 PIN modular jack connector.

Ok, not all 3B2 8 pin modular jack connectors are created "EQUAL".
These beasties are used for running StarLan 1MBit, EPORTS cards,
PORTS cards, as well as for running ETHERNET 10MBits as well.

The pin outs for the two modular jack cables on the back of the
3B2, as well as for the PORTS card should be as follows:

The 2 modular jacks on the back of your machine should be labeled
console and contty.  If your talking about a PORTS card, here is
what one looks like:

                        plugging serial terminals into your 3B2.

The EPORTS card is card that has 8 RJ45 connectors (8 pin modular
jacks) on it.  This card is where you would want to plug a high
speed modem onto your system, because the above connectors DO NOT
SUPPORT HARDWARE FLOW CONTROL.  The PIN OUTS for the EPORTS card
is as follows:

* NOTES:

CTS & RTS (if you have them).
	Most 3B2 systems need to do the following to enable hardware
	flow control.  Otherwise the 3B2 will ignore RTS & CTS.
	Also see the FAQ item about handing high speed modems on
	EPORTS cards for more detailed information.

	epstty hfc    <-- XON/XOFF flow control must be disabled
			  before you do this.  The stty command is
			  one way to disable XON/XOFF.  Line
			  DISCIPLINES are another way to do this.
			  See etc/gettydefs file.

DTR0 notes. {3B2 uses this to signal DISCONNECT}

	When the 3B2 is active on the port  (waiting for someone
	to logon to the port or whatever.), DTR is active.   When
	the 3B2 wishes to DISCONNECT (ie, too many wrong passwords,
	or the user logs off the port), it will lower DTR momentarily.
	If you are trying to get a modem to work, you might want
	the modem to DISCONNECT the user when DTR is dropped..

DCD0 notes. {Used to tell 3B2 that the user has DROPPED CARRIER}

	When the DCD is set inactive, the 3B2 will assume that the
	user has either turned off the terminal, or dropped carrier.
	If this occurs, the user is logged off the system, and
	background tasks are aborted.  If DCD is inactive, be
	aware that NONE of the standard AT&T provided utilities
	are capable of sending anything to the device.  There is
	a way to get around this in the more recent releases of
	the 3B2's OS.  See your admin documentation for details.

	Otherwise, in the case of a MODEM, when the user drops
	carrier, you want the modem to "momentarily" lower this
	DCD0 just long enough for the 3B2 to realize that the user
	has dropped carrier.  The modem should then Re-ENABLE DCD0,
	so that the 3B2 will be able to send data to the modem.
	{needed for cu, and outbound UUCP to work correctly in
	older releases of the OS}

	Most semi-decent modems are capable of handling DCD and
	DTR in a 3B2 friendly manner.  I have done this with PEP's,
	USR HST's, and MicroComm 9600 AX modems, without incident.

Subject: Lucid Emacs 19.4 released
Resent-From: info-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu

Lucid GNU Emacs 19.4 is now available.  This is a version of GNU Emacs derived
from an early version of Emacs version 19 from the Free Software Foundation.

(If you are already a user of version 19.3, you might want to skip ahead to
the section labeled "Differences Between 19.3 and 19.4".)

You can get it via anonymous FTP from labrea.Stanford.EDU (36.8.0.112).  It
is currently available only by FTP.  We don't have the manpower to make tapes
right now.

Log in with the user "anonymous" and "username@host" as a password (that is,
your email address.)  Execute the command "cd pub/gnu/lucid/".  These are
the files you will find there:

  lemacs-19.4.tar.Z
	The complete source distribution.  This file is about 9 megabytes.
	When untarred and uncompressed, the source distribution will take up
	about 22 megs. You will need an additional 12 megs or so to compile it.

  lemacs-19.4-sun4.tar.Z
	This is a ready-to-run set of Sun4 executables, and a DOC file.  If
	you want to use these executables, you will still need to get the file
	lemacs-19.4.tar.Z, because Emacs cannot function very well without the
	lisp library online.  This file is about 2.5 megs, 4.9 megs when
	unpacked, 3.6 megs of which is the Emacs executable itself (2.5 megs if
	stripped.)  This version of lemacs is compiled with support for Motif
	dialog boxes and XPM files.

  xpm-3.2a.tar.Z
	The XPM library (optional.)

Don't forget to set "binary" mode when transferring these files.  Unpack them
with some variation of the command "zcat lemacs-19.4.tar.Z | tar -vxf -".

We have created two mailing lists for discussing our Emacs.

   bug-lucid-emacs@lucid.com	For reporting all bugs in Lucid GNU Emacs,
				including bugs in the compilation and
				installation procedures.

   help-lucid-emacs@lucid.com	For random questions and conversation
				about using Lucid GNU Emacs.

To be added or removed from these mailing lists, send mail to
bug-lucid-emacs-request@lucid.com or help-lucid-emacs-request@lucid.com.

The bug-lucid-emacs and help-lucid-emacs mailing lists are archived on labrea,
and are bidirectionally gatewayed into the newsgroups alt.lucid-emacs.bug and
alt.lucid-emacs.help.

The bug-lucid-emacs and help-lucid-emacs mailing lists are archived on labrea.

Please do not send messages about problems with Lucid GNU Emacs to the FSF
GNU Emacs newsgroups and mailing lists (help-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu,
bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu, gnu.emacs.help, gnu.emacs.bug, et cetera)
unless you are sure that the problem you are reporting is a problem with
both versions of GNU Emacs.  People who aren't subscribed to the Lucid GNU
Emacs mailing lists most likely are not interested in hearing about problems
with it.


Why Another Version of Emacs?
=============================

Lucid's latest product, Energize, is a C/C++ development environment.  Rather
than invent (and force our users to learn) a new user-interface, we chose to
build part of our environment on top of the world's best editor, GNU Emacs.
(Though our product is commercial, the work we did on GNU Emacs is free
software, and is useful without having to purchase our product.)

We needed a version of Emacs with mouse-sensitive regions, multiple fonts,
the ability to mark sections of a buffer as read-only, the ability to detect
which parts of a buffer has been modified, and many other features.

Why Not Epoch?
==============

For our purposes, the existing version of Epoch was not sufficient; it did
not allow us to put arbitrary pixmaps/icons in buffers, `undo' did not
restore changes to regions, regions did not overlap and merge their
attributes in the way we needed, and several other things.

We could have devoted our time to making Epoch do what we needed (and, in
fact, we spent some time doing that) but, since the FSF planned to include
Epoch-like features in their version 19, we decided that our efforts would
be better spent improving Emacs19 instead of Epoch.

Our original hope was that our changes to Emacs would be incorporated into
the "official" v19.  However, scheduling conflicts arose, and we found that,
given the amount of work still remaining to be done, we didn't have time to
merge with the FSF's code.  Consequently, we have released our work as a
forked branch of Emacs, instead of delaying any longer.

Work has begun on a merger of Epoch and Lucid Emacs.  It seems likely that
the next release of Epoch will be based on Lucid Emacs instead of GNU Emacs
from the FSF.  At some point, Lucid Emacs and Epoch will probably be the
same thing.

No Warranty
===========

Lucid Emacs is distributed under exactly the same terms as GNU Emacs, and
thus has no warranty of any kind.

However, if you have received this version of Emacs with Energize, then it is
covered by your Energize support contract.  If you have received it through
some other means, then you may buy a support contract for it from Lucid.
Send mail to lucid-info@lucid.com for more information about Lucid Emacs or
Energize.

What's Different?
=================

Lucid Emacs *currently* requires X Windows to run, though it will not be much
work to make it run on dumb ttys again.  We plan to do this eventually.

We have not personally tried to compile this version of Emacs under anything
but SunOS 4.1 on SparcStations, though others have successfully done so.  We
are very eager to get feedback about portability problems from those who
compile it on other systems.

We have reimplemented the basic input model in a more general way; instead of
X input being a special-case of the normal ASCII input stream, Emacs has a
concept of "input events", and ASCII characters are a subset of that.  The
events that Emacs knows about are not X events, but are a generalization of
them, so that Emacs can eventually be ported to different window systems.

We have reimplemented keymaps so that sequences of events can be stored into
them instead of just ASCII codes; it is possible to, for example, bind
different commands to each of the chords Control-h, Control-H, Backspace,
Control-Backspace, and Super-Shift-Backspace.  Key bindings, function key
bindings, and mouse bindings live in the same keymaps.

Input and display of all ISO-8859-1 characters is supported.

You can have multiple X Windows ("screens" in Emacs terminology).

Our Emacs has objects called "extents" and "faces", which are roughly
analogous to Epoch's "buttons," "zones," and "styles."  An extent is a region
of text (a start position and an end position) and a face is a collection of
textual attributes like fonts and colors.  Every extent is displayed in some
"face", so changing the properties of a face immediately updates the display
of all associated extents.  Faces can be screen-local: you can have a region
of text which displays with completely different attributes when its buffer
is viewed from a different X window.

The display attributes of faces may be specified either in lisp or through
the X resource manager.

Emacs use the MIT "Xt" toolkit instead of raw Xlib calls, which makes it be
a more well-behaved X citizen (and also improves portability).  A result of
this is that it is possible to include other Xt "Widgets" in the Emacs
window.  Also, Emacs understands the standard Xt command-line arguments.

Emacs understands the X11 "Selection" mechanism; it's possible to define
and customize selection converter functions and new selection types from
elisp, without having to recompile Emacs.

Emacs now supports the Zmacs/Lispm style of region highlighting, where the
region between the point and mark is highlighted when in its "active" state.

Emacs has a menubar, whose contents are customizable from emacs-lisp.
This menubar looks Motif-ish, but does not require Motif.  If you already
own Motif, however, you can configure Emacs to use a *real* Motif menubar
instead.  If you have OLIT ("OpenLook Intrinsics"), you can use an
OpenWindows-like menubar.

Emacs can ask questions using popup dialog boxes.  Any command executed from
a menu will ask yes/no questions with dialog boxes, while commands executed
via the keyboard will use the minibuffer.

The initial load-path is computed at run-time, instead of at compile-time.
This means that if you move the Emacs executable and associated directories
to somewhere else, you don't have to recompile anything.

Emacs now supports floating-point numbers.

Emacs now knows about timers directly, instead of them being simulated by
a subprocess.

Emacs understands truenames, and can be configured to notice when you are
visiting two names of the same file.

If you're running on a sun SparcStation, you can specify sound files for
Emacs to play instead of the default X beep.

Much more detail about the differences between Lucid Emacs and Emacs 18 can
be found in the file .../etc/NEWS (accessible with ``C-h n''.)

Note that building Lucid Emacs requires an ANSI C compiler, like gcc, or
Lucid's own (and the galaxy's best) Lucid C/C++.


Major Differences Between 19.3 and 19.4
=======================================

Prototypes have been added for all functions.  Emacs compiles in the strict
ANSI modes of lcc and gcc, so portability should be vastly improved.

Many many many many core leaks have been plugged, especially in screen
creation and deletion.

The float support reworked to be more portable and ANSI conformant.  This
resulted in these new configuration parameters: HAVE_INVERSE_HYPERBOLIC,
HAVE_CBRT, HAVE_RINT, FLOAT_CHECK_ERRNO, FLOAT_CATCH_SIGILL,
FLOAT_CHECK_DOMAIN.  Let us know if you had to change the defaults on your
architecture.

The SunOS unexec has been rewritten, and now works with either static or
dynamic libraries, depending on whether -Bstatic or -Bdynamic were specified
at link-time.

Small (character-sized) bitmaps can be mixed in with buffer text via the new
functions set-extent-begin-glyph and set-extent-end-glyph.  (This is actually
a piece of functionality that Energize has been using for a while, but we've
just gotten around to making it possible to use it without Energize.  See how
nice we are?  Go buy our product.)

If compiled with Motif support, one can pop up dialog boxes from emacs lisp.
We encourage someone to contribute Athena an version of this code; it
shouldn't be much work.

If dialog boxes are available, then y-or-n-p and yes-or-no-p use dialog boxes
instead of the minibuffer if invoked as a result of a command that was
executed from a menu instead of from the keyboard.

Multiple screen support works better; check out doc of get-screen-for-buffer.

The default binding of backspace is the same as delete.  (C-h is still help.)

A middle click while the minibuffer is active does completion if you click on
a highlighted completion, otherwise it executes the global binding of button2.

New versions of Barry Warsaw's c++-mode and syntax.c.  Font-lock-mode works
with C++ mode now.

The semantics of activate-menubar-hook has changed; the functions are called
with no arguments now.

`truename' no longer hacks the automounter; use directory-abbrev-alist instead.

Most minibuffer handling has been reimplemented in emacs-lisp.

Subject: Announcing c++-mode.el version 2.261


[[I don't think this made it out the first time. Sorry for any
  duplication... baw]]

This message is to announce the release of c++-mode.el version 2.261
for GNU emacs and derivatives (Epoch, Lucid emacs).  This version
should replace all previous versions, including the last public
release 2.195.  Differences between 2.195 and 2.261 are briefly
outlined below. c++-mode.el can be used to edit C++, K&R C, and ANSI C
code.

As usual, I'm not posting the lisp file since it should be pretty easy
for just about everyone to get it via anonymous ftp or mail-server.
2.261 should be available soon on the elisp archive, but you can also
aftp it from ftp.cme.nist.gov:pub/gnu/c++-mode.el.Z. For those of you
without aftp, send the following message to library@cme.nist.gov:

	send pub/gnu/c++-mode.el.Z

Be sure that you include a valid reply path. When you receive the
response, you need to remove the mail headers and other cruft,
uudecode, then uncompress.  For more information about the
mail-server, send the message `help' (sans quotes) to the library
address.

Read the comments at the top of the file for information about getting
on the beta testers list, and submitting bug reports.

Performance
===========
There have been lots of complaints about performance with 2.195. These
problems are related to bugs in emacs which prohibit more than 1 style
of comments per buffer. C++, of course, requires 2 styles of comments.
c++-mode employs lisp workarounds so that indentation is accurate, but
lisp is slower than using the C built-ins.  I've tried to speed up the
lisp routines as much as possible, but you'll still notice c++-mode
getting slow inside big routines, or in a file of preprocessor
commands.  The solution is to patch emacs...

...which has been done for you as of the 19.4 Lucid Emacs release!
Tons 'o thanks to Jamie Zawinski for working with me on these. Lemacs
19.4 also comes with 2.261 so lemacsers win big.  c++-mode can
recognize a patched emacs and will automatically use the faster
built-in routines. Also, backslashing certain characters (e.g. single
quote) inside comment regions are unnecessary when the patches are
installed and c++-mode will automatically set the value of the
c++-untame-characters variable to nil in a patched emacs.

Jack Repenning has ported the lemacs patches back into GNU emacs 18.59
and this will be submitted to the gnu.emacs.sources newsgroup in a
companion article (thanks Jack!).  The patches will also be made
available on ftp.cme.nist.gov for access via aftp and mail-server,
under the file name pub/gnu/syntax-18.59.Z. Of course, these are *not*
official GNU patches. Volunteers to port the patches to Epoch are
welcome!

Other Changes Since 2.195
=========================

* LOTS OF BUG FIXES. I won't bore you with the details, but almost all
  reported bugs have been fixed. There are still some problems with
  indentation of continued statements at the top level (ie not inside
  functions), and re-indenting continued statements with
  c++-indent-exp (ESC C-q).

* function c++-fill-C-comment has been removed.

* variable c++-class-member-indent has been removed. c-indent-level is
  now used to determine indentation inside class definitions.

* column-zero comment only lines need not be anchored to column-zero.
  See the docstring for variable c++-comment-only-line-offset for more
  information.

* new variable c++-backscan-limit to improve performance when *not*
  running a patched emacs. This limits how far back lisp back-scanning
  will look at the expense of occasionally (hopefully, very rarely)
  being wrong. This feature is not used in patched emacses.

* new functions c++-backward-sexp and c++-forward-sexp are bound to
  M-C-b and M-C-f respectively.  These work better than backward-sexp
  and forward-sexp for c++-mode.

Enjoy,

UUCP Mail, News, and Gateway Software for PCs and MACs
Eric S Johansson
Version: Issue #3.2 - Preliminary
Last Updated: Dec 29, 1992
Posted to: comp.mail.uucp, news.software.readers, vmsnet.uucp

This document is a list of UUCP Mail, News and Gateway implementations for the
PC and MAC. It does not currently include TCP/IP, POPn, SMTP, IMAP, or NNTP
packages unless they also support UUCP. If you have additions or changes please
send them to me:

Eric S Johansson  esj@harvee.billerica.ma.us

Because I do not have much spare time, I am very slow at getting updates
incorporated into this document.  When sending updates, the closer you can
make the changes to a cut and paste, the sooner I will get the changes
into this FAQ.  Thanks for the help.

I would like to include news and mail packages for personal computers
other than DOS and Macintosh boxes (like the Atari ST and Amiga).  Please
tell me what you know and I will include it.

Attributions:

I received this document from James H. Thompson (jimmy_t@verifone.com)
shortly after I foolishly proclaimed that I would build and maintain
a UUPC supplier FAQ.  Thank you Jim for building this document and to
all the people who sent the information used to build this document.

 profound Windows application to hit my desktop."

    as other helpful utilities to maintain active files, news and mail rc files,
    and user mailboxes.

    Unlike other packages, FSUUCP implements these programmes as DOS commands
    directly. By putting the executables on your PATH, and setting an environment
    variable pointing to your configuration file, you can have UNIX mail and news
    on your MSDOS machine from the prompt, just like UNIX.

UUCP? I recommend FSUUCP from Chris Fubar. Its a complete package for
dial-up UUCP from a DOS machine. More advanced versions are also
available, but are not shareware. It took me about an hour to get UUCP up and
running from my DOS mail machine.

I met Chris at Uniforum. As I said, I recommend the product. It uses the
UUCP -g protocol over most modems. 2400 bps is just fine, if you dont have
long distance calls or large amounts of files, news and mail to transfer.
..
In a sense, one could say this is a QWK door-reader package, which are so
popular on DOS/PCBOARD BBSes, but based on UUCP.

        MUSH = Mail User's Shell
        This packages appears on a number of PC BBS systems. The
        documentation states that it has no PC support, however the
        author assures me that it does work on PCs.

Reviews:

-- From: "UNIX EMail Software - a Survey"
Posted in the comp.mail.misc newsgroup February 17, 1992

    mush: author Dan Heller* <argv@z-code.com>

    The "Mail User's Shell" is a "shell" for mail users.  That is, it
    has its own environment where you can configure not only the user
    interface, but the actual internal mechanisms.  Internally, mush
    has a csh-like scripting language, altho it's not as powerful as
    csh.  It has command-line aliases, file completion, if-else state-
    ments, command piping, and so on.  Because you can build your own
    commands, you can virtually build your own library of email features.

    Mush has two tty-based interfaces: the standard tty-mode (ala BSD
    Mail or sys-v mailx) and the fullscreen/curses mode (ala vi, emacs
    or even Elm).  You can set up key bindings that execute one or more
    mush commands, personalized commands or even UNIX commands.  You
    can even emulate keyboard input with keyboard macros and mappings.

    Mush also has a SunView interface that is more powerful than Sun's
    Mailtool, yet backwards compatible with most versions.  Most sunview
    users (if there are any left these days) prefer MushView over Mailtool.

    The current version of Mush is 7.2.3, last posted in comp.sources.misc
    volume 18 (with subsequent patches).  All three interfaces are
    available in one runtime binary.  Except for the MushView interface
    (which is only available on for suns), Mush is portable to everything
    that runs UNIX.  There is also a DOS port available for PCs and can
    run on most 286 machines. An older version of Mush (6.5) can run on
    as little as 640 of RAM.  (Mush-PC is typically used with UUPC.)

    The "next generation" of Mush is a commercial product called Z-Mail
    from Z-Code Software (mail argv@z-code.com for details).  All aspects
    of Mush are retained, yet it has grown to be far more powerful.  It
    runs under X windows with either a Motif or Open Look interface
    and also supports multi-media, user "functions" and a suite of new
    features.

    Third party documentation is available from O'Reilly in the book
    entitled "The Z-Mail Handbook" (by Hanna Nelson).  This book not only
    covers Z-Mail, but Mush as well.

    Mush stores its messages in "mbox" format, or MMDF format if you're
    using MMDF as your MTA.

    The newsgroup comp.mail.mush is dedicated to it.

    [Note: Z-Mail is not related at all to Zmailer.  Zmailer is a MTA]

Subject:Question on DOS-MUSH
Date: 4 Mar 92 03:34:14 GMT
I've been trying to get the DOS-MUSH off of SIMTEL to work.  It's a port of
7.1 for the IBM.  Most of the stuff works fine, but some commands like ls and
using mush to send mail result in Access Denied results, which is quite strange
since my IBM has no concept of permissions.  The access denied results are
always for directories...I don't know if that means anything or not.  Any
ideas?  I tried running it without the things that I assumed could be causing
problems (namely DesqView and 4dos), but the results still came out exactly
the same.

    Mail user agent.  Works with: KA9Q NOS, UUPC or Waffle

    Quoting from the documentation:

     PCElm is a mail user agent (UA) with a user interface closely
     modeled after the USENET ELM. To avoid confusion, we would like to
     mention that PCElm and USENET ELM are *not* related.

     PCElm is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for BM when
     using the KA9Q NOS package or as a replacement for mail.exe when
     using UUPC. It can also be used for other mail systems, as all relevant
     things for compatibility with MTA's (Message Transfer Agents) are
     configurable.

     Highlights:
     PCElm has a nice user interface, with easy to learn and easy to use
     commands. UN*X users will already be familiar with the more important
     commands. It can be made to work with just about every mail system
     there is for PC's, as PCElm makes no assumptions at all about the
     underlying network software. Finally, PCElm is multilingual; you can
     make all messages appear in your favorite language. Message files
     for English and German currently exist.

    Quoting from the documentation:

          1. INTRODUCTION
               This  guide covers  the  system operations  except the  user
          interface. It  will give you  a basic  idea on how  to setup  and
          manage a USENet News  (or NetNews) connection. It does  not cover
          UUCP (from  the UUPC program), what  news is, or how  to obtain a
          news  connection. It  also  does not  cover  rules or  ethics  of
          NetNews.  PCNews is a full  news system. It  contains a full user
          interface for  reading and  posting news.  It also  contains full
          programs for deleting news  by date or usage. The  PCNews package
          is  also a full news server to  send news feeds to other systems.
          PCNews has also successfully  been used in multi-user and  multi-
          workstation (Networked) environments. The whole PCNews package is
          similar to the B-News found  on UNIX systems. PCNews is  only for
          the  DOS environment, if you wish to  use a NetNews package under
          UNIX, this is not it. You would be better off with B-News 2.11 or
          C-News.
Reviews:
--John Covici  <covici@ccs.covici.com> in News posting of 4-FEB-1992:
"This is a very nice news package for MS-DOS.  It includes full
control message processing (the only one I know of on DOS) and other
nice features.  You need uupc-extended 1.11r to use this.
This package is still in beta, but it seems pretty solid."

    Pmail 2.3 is the legendary "standalone" Pmail: it can run without NetWare,
    and has limited support for non-NetWare LANs. A sample user-defined gateway
    which interfaces Pmail to Waffle 1.6x for uucp mail is included in the
    distribution archive, as is comprehensive documentation on user-defined
    gateways. An Asynch mail gateway will be released for 2.3 in the next few
    weeks.

    Changes from previous versions:
    *  User-defined gateway support has been heavily improved, and a quite
    comprehensive guide is included, along with a sample gateway, both
    source and executable to interface to Waffle.

   New version of Pegasus mail has just been release, and I have tested with
Novell 386 v3.11 and Waffle 1.64.. Neat.. It runs perfect..
   Pmail can call uucico directly or read directly from the user directory..
You have a choice of either login waffle and read mail or using Pmail
which has a great user interface (color, fullscreen) etc, like NOvell..
   Until Chrome come out, I'll have to settle with Pmail..

Threaded newsreader with killfiles and crosspost filtering for ms-dos waffle.
(see also trived07.zip in <msdos.editor> section for a companion editor)

with v0.9, rusnews can be run over the phone lines.  when run over the
phone lines, it defaults to a non-trusted mode (which can be overridden
by the command line (using different extern entries)) which does not
allow users to edit articles or change their From: lines.

Additional Redeeming Features
-----------------------------

- compatible with waffle - no separate database or maintenance required
- hit `k' while reading to kill that subject or author, either in that
  group or in all groups
- automatic filtering of crossposts - any article which is crossposted
  will only be shown if the group you're reading is the first one in your
  join file to which it was posted.
- can be used over a phone line

Limitations
-----------

quite a few - listed in start of rusnews.pas

the one that will seem to concern most users will be lack of posting
capability.  I send out far more email than postings, and I don't miss
it much yet.  I personally believe this tends to keep the quality of
net postings higher, since flamage is confined to the one person to
whom you're sending mail, as opposed to being broadcast to the world.
maybe I just flame too often. :-)

Notable Features:
    'Simple NEWS' is an news add-on for UUPC.  It is intended for use as a
    leaf node and offers:
      - Threaded news reading.  This allows you to be much more
        selective about what you read, enabling you to cover many more
        newsgroups.
      - The when a cross-posted article is read the news-reader marks all
        the other instances of the article as read too.
      - Separate rc files are kept for each user, which record the individual
        articles that you have seen.  This is in contrast to some readers
        which simply record the highest article number read.  The user is
        defined, as for mail users, in the file pointed to by the UUPCUSRRC
        environment variable.
      - Usual range of response facilities: follow-up news, reply by mail,
        forward by mail, save article/thread to disk.
      - Articles are now stored in one file per newsgroup, rather than
        one file per article.  This results in an enormous saving (up to 3:1)
        in disk space on disks with with a default cluster size of 4kb per
        cluster.
      - Processing of batched/compressed news.  Unbatched and uncompressed
        are not processed.  Control messages are not processed.
      - Posting - Posts are unbatched and uncompressed.  You can only post
        to your 'mailserv'.  You cannot feed another site.  Posting can only
        be done from within the news reader SNEWS.  If you are looking for
        something to feed other sites why not try Waffle?
      - 'Received date' oriented expire to maintain the news database.

    Msg from Author - 4-May-1992
    Firstly there is a new release which fixes many of the deficiencies in
    version 1.12, and cleans up/replaces much crufty code.  This release has
    been prepared by a group of Australians, coordinated by Michael Studte
    <michael@izumi.dialix.oz.au>.

Reviews:
-- Steve Kohlenberger  <presoft!Steve@uunet.uu.net> review with posting
SNEWS is a simple news program to be compatible with the UUCP package
called UUPC.  I have been happily using it for a few months now and
watched it improve.  It handles all my basic needs and I am
comfortable with it.  It also saves a lot of disk space because all
the messages for one message group are saved in one file and a
corresponding index file.  That literally cut my disk space usage
down to less than half of what it was.  Its relatively fast and quite
easy to install and use.
I can recommend it for anyone with a recent copy of UUPC, some
version of DOS, and a news feed.

-- Russ Nelson <cheetah.ece.clarkson.edu!nelson> on uupc-info list  9-APR-1992
Subj:   Simple News works great.
I'm using Simple News to read news now.  Works great, although the code
is a bit crufty in spots.  However, it works quite nicely, and was very
easy to install.

There are 3 good ones currently.

Waffle has full USENET news/mail/uucp in addition to being an actual
dial-in/dial-out BBS. Available on SIMTEL20 in pd1:<msdos.waffle>
Shareware $30.00

UUPC/Extended has uucp/mail (no USENET unless you use one of the
add-in packages like 'snews').  Available in pd1:<msdos.uucp>
Totally free.

FSUUCP has news/mail but I'm not sure if it has uucp or not.
Available in pd1:<msdos.uucp>, shareware $35.00 or so.

I've run them all and would recommend Waffle over the others
by a wide margin, especially if you want to have your system
up all the time 'answering the phone'.  It also has a wonderful
cron facility so you can automate your system dialing out, etc.
to save phone $$$ by calling at night. There's really nothing that
it can't do very reliably and simply.

                   WWIVnet: 1@500
News Support: Yes
Price:  Shareware - Registration $25
Availability:
    The latest version of WWCP will always be available on The Fredbox
    (907) 344-8437 (@502 WWIVnet), Someplace Else BBS (907) 338-1612
    (@9702 WWIVnet), Virtual Reality (907) 345-7728 (@9704 WWIVnet).

    WWCP is also available by email. The most recent version can be retrieved
    by sending mail to file-request%cybrspc@cs.umn.edu, with the message

    /GET wwcp/wwcp120.arj

    Do not include a signature, unless you really want to see the help
    file. The /GET *is* case-sensitive, unfortunately.
    WWCP should be uploaded to wsmr-simtel20.army.mil very soon, for
    those who would rather retrieve the package by FTP.

Support: Author available through email, also a WWIV netsub (similar to
         a newsgroup).
Source code available: No
Platforms supported: PC running Waffle
Protocols supported: XYZmodem and HS/Link for the WWIVnet connect
Notable Features:
    The WWCP package allows you to exchange email between the WWIVnet
    and the Waffle BBS (and thus, Usenet/Internet if the Waffle system is
    connected). WWIV netsubs can be carrried as newsgroups on the Waffle
    system and vice-versa. The interface is totally invisible to the user. No
    kludges (such as manually adding special address lines to email or posts)
    are necessary. All routing is fully automatic.

            WWCP runs on the Waffle system. No special setup is necessary
    for the WWIVnet connect. As far as WWIVnet can tell, the Waffle system
    looks like a normal WWIVnet node. WWCP is shareware with a $25
    registration fee.

I've been extremely happy with uAccess. Even though it is a bit expensive, it

the kludgy way it does things. If you seriously need uucp mail, and you can't
afford to have something make your machine something you're afraid to touch,
it's probably worth it. If I could afford to use it as my network email system,
I probably would recommend it over MS Mail/QuickMail."

Here is some information that might whet people's curiosity.  Please

If people can understand the extant code reasonably well with only
about two questions, and they have time to do work, there are a number
of projects that can be done by other people to help out with the
Hurd.

		TOWARDS A NEW STRATEGY OF OPERATING SYSTEM DESIGN

PART 1 -- What we are doing

The fundamental purpose of an operating system is to enable a variety
of programs to share a single computer efficiently.  Efficiency
demands things such as memory protection, preemptively scheduled
timesharing, and coordinated access to I/O peripherals.  In addition,
operating systems can allow a variety of users to share a computer
efficiently.  The same general areas apply here as well: preventing
users from harming each other, enabling them to share without prior
arrangement, and mediating access to physical devices.

On today's computer systems, implementing these goals usually involves
a large program, called the kernel, which mediates all these
exchanges.  Since this program must be accessible to all user
programs, it becomes a natural place to add functionality to the
system.  As time goes by, more and more gets added to the kernel,
because the only model for interaction between processes is that of
specific, individual services provided by the kernel.

The traditional system allows users to add components to the mammoth
shared library "vmunix" only if they understand most of that library,
and only if they have a privileged status within the system.  Testing
these new components requires a much more painful edit-compile-debug
cycle than other programs, and cannot be done while others are using
the system.  Bugs usually cause fatal system crashes, further
disrupting others' use of the system.  All of the kernel is usually
non-pageable, [fn: There are systems with pageable kernels.  However,
deciding what can be pageable is difficult and error prone.  As well,
the mechanisms are usually quite complex, making them difficult to use
by people wanting to add simple extensions.] further adding to the
cost of adding functions to it.

Because of these restrictions, functionality which properly belongs
"behind" the wall of the traditional kernel is usually left out of
systems unless it is absolutely mandatory.  Many good ideas, best
implemented with an open/read/write interface cannot be implemented
because of the problems inherent in the monolithic nature of
traditional systems.  Further, even for those with the endurance to
implement such ideas, only those who are privileged users of their
computers can do so.  The software copyright system, preventing
unlicensed people from even reading the kernel source, only compounds
the problem still more.

Some systems have addressed these difficulties.  Smalltalk-80 and the
Lisp Machine both represent one method of getting around the problem.
System code is not distinguished from user code; all of the system is
accessible to the user, and can be changed as need be.  Both systems
were built around languages that facilitated such easy replacement and
extension, and were moderately successful.  These systems, however,
were fairly poor at insulating users and programs from each other,
thus failing one of the principle goals of operating system design.

Most projects using the Mach 3.0 kernel today carry on the same
tradition of operating system design.  The internal structure of the
system has changed, but the same heavy barrier between user and system
remains.  The single-servers, while fairly easy to construct, inherit
quite naturally all the deficiencies of the monolithic kernels from
which they came.

Most multi-server projects do somewhat better.  Much more of the
system is pageable.  The system is more easily debugged, and testing
of new system components need not interfere with other users.  But
there is still a wall between the user and the system, and no user can
cross that wall without special privilege.

The GNU Hurd, by contrast, is designed to make the area of "system"
code as limited as possible.  Users are only required to communicate
with the kernel; the rest of the system is replacable dynamically.
Users can use whatever parts of the remainder of the system they want,
and can add components themselves, easily, for other users to take
advantage of.  No mutual trust need exist in advance for users to use
each other's services, nor does the system become vulnerable by
trusting the services of arbitrary users.

We have done this by identifying those components of the system which
users must use in order to communicate with each other.  One of these
is a mechanism responsible for identifying users' identities.  This
program is called the authentication server.  Programs must
communicate, each with an authentication server they trust, in order
to establish each other's identities.  The other is a mechanism for
establishing control over system components by the superuser, and
global bookkeeping operations.  This server is called the process
server.

No user program needs to communicate with the process server at all;
it is only necessary for users which require its services.  The
authentication server is only necessary for programs which wish to
establish their identity to another agent.  All remaining services in
the system carry no special status.  This includes the network
implementation, the filesystems, the exec mechanism (including
setuid), and so forth.



		THE TRANSLATOR MECHANISM

The Hurd uses Mach ports primarily as methods for communicating
between users and servers.  Each port implements a particular set of
protocols, representing operations that can be undertaken on the
underlying object represented by the port.  Some of the protocols
specified by the Hurd are the I/O protocol, used for generic I/O
operations; the file protocol, used for filesystem operations; the
socket protocol, used for network operations; the process protocol,
used for manipulating processes; and so forth.

Most servers are accessed by opening files.  Normally, opening a file
results in a port associated with that file, owned by the same server
as the directory containing the file.  For example, a disk based
filesystem would normally be serving a large number of ports, each
representing an open file or directory.  When a new file is opened the
server creates a new port, associates it with the file, and returns a
send right to the user.

However, a file can have a "translator" associated with it.  In this
case, rather than returning its own port referring to the contents of
the file, the server executes a program, called the translator.  This
program is provided a port to the actual contents of the file, and is
then asked to return a port to the original user to complete the open
operation.

This mechanism is used quite obviously for mount.  A mount point would
have a translator associated with it.  When a user opens the mount
point, the translator, in this case, a program which understands the
disk format of the mounted filesystem, is executed, and returns a port
to the user.  Once the translator is started, it need not be run
again, unless it dies; the parent filesystem retains a port to the
translator to use in further requests.  Translators are guaranteed
that new programs will not be started for further open operations.

Translators can be associated with files by the owner of the file,
needing no additional permission.  As a result, any program can be
specified as a translator.  Obviously the system will not work
properly if the translator does not implement the file protocol
correctly, or at all.  The system is so constructed, however, to cause
an interruptible hang to be the worst possible result.

One way to use translators, then, is to access hierarchically
structured data using the file protocol.  All the complexity of the
user interface to the ftp program, for example, is then removed.
Users need only know that a particular directory represents FTP, and
can use all the standard file manipulation commands, ls, cp, mv, and
so forth, to access the remote system, rather than learning a new set.
Similarly, the complexity of tar can be eased by a simple translator.
[fn: Such transparent access to tar would not necessarily be cheap,
though it would be convenient.]


		GENERIC SERVICES

Another way to use translators is to use the filesystem as a
rendezvous for interfaces which are not similar to files.  Consider a
service which implements some version of the X protocol using Mach
messages as an underlying transport.  For each X display, a file can
be created with the appropriate program as its translator.  X clients
would open that file.  At that point, most file operations (read and
write, for example) would not be useful, but new operations
(XCreateWindow or XDrawText) might become meaningful.  In this kind of
case, the filesystem protocol is used further only to manipulate
characteristics of the node used for the rendezvous.  The node need
not support I/O operations, though it should reply to any such
messages with a "message not understood" return code.  (If MiG stubs
are used to demultiplex messages, this will happen automatically.)

This technique is used to contact most of the services in the Hurd
which are not structured like hierarchical filesystems.  For example,
the password server, which hands out authorization tags in exchange
for passwords, is contacted this way.  Network protocol servers as
well are contacted in this fashion.  Roland McGrath thought up this
use of translators.


		CLEVER FILESYSTEM PICTURES

The third common method of using translators in the Hurd is to present
a filesystem-like view of another part of the filesystem, with some
semantics changed.  For example, it might be nice to have a filesystem
which cannot be changed, but records changed versions of its files
elsewhere.  (This might be useful for source code management.)  A
translator is available which presents "that directory" with all
changes going "over there instead".

Similarly, a translator is available which creates a directory which
is a conceptual union of a number of other directories, with collision
resolution rules of various sorts.  A variety of other ideas have been
presented which do similar things.


		WHAT THE USER CAN DO

None of these translators gain extra privilege by virtue of being
hooked into the filesystem.  Translators run with the uid of the owner
of the file being translated, and can only be set or changed by that
owner.  The I/O and filesystem protocols are carefully designed to
allow their use by mutually untrusting clients and servers.

Translators are just ordinary programs.  There are a variety of
facilities in the GNU C library to make common sorts of translators
easier to write.  Some translators which might appear to need special
privilege are those which allow setuid exec or the password server
referred to above.  In fact, these translators could be run by anyone.
Only if they are set on a root-owned node, however, would they be able
to successfully provide all their services.  This is analogous to
letting any user call the reboot system call, but only honoring it if
that user is root.


		WHY THIS IS SO DIFFERENT

What this system organization lets users do is completely novel in the
Unixoid world.  To this point, operating systems have kept huge
portions of this functionality in the realm of system code, thus
preventing its modification and extension, except in cases of extreme
need.  Individual users cannot replace parts of the system in their
programs no matter how much easier that would make their task, and
system managers are loath to install random tweaks off the net into
their kernels.

In our system, users can change almost all of the things which are
decided for them in advance by traditional systems.  In combination
with the tremendous control given by the Mach kernel over task address
spaces and so forth, for the first time we have a system in which
users will be able to replace parts of the system they dislike,
without disrupting other users of the same system.

Most Mach-based operating systems to date have concentrated, instead,
on implementing a wider set of the "same old" Unix semantics in a new
environment.  By contrast, we are extending those semantics in ways
that allow users to bypass or replace them, virtually arbitrarily.


PART 2 -- What we are doing, in detail


		THE AUTHENTICATION SERVER

One of the most central servers in the Hurd is the authentication
server.  Each port to the authentication server identifies a user, and
is associated by the authentication server with an "id block".  Each
id block contains a set of user ids and a set of group ids.  Either
set may be empty.  This server is not the same as the "password
server" referred to above.

There are three services exported by the authentication server.
First, the authentication server provides simple boolean operations on
authentication ports.  Given a two authentication ports, the
authentication server will provide a third port representing the union
of the two sets of uids and gids.

Second, the authentication server allows any user with a uid of zero
to create an arbitrary authentication port.

Finally, the authentication server provides RPC's which allow mutually
untrusting clients and servers to establish identity and pass initial
information on each other.  This is crucial to the security of the
filesystem and I/O protocols, for example.

Any user could write a program which implements the authentication
protocol.  This does not, however, violate the security of the system.
When a given service needs to authenticate a user, it communicates
with its trusted authentication server.  If that user is using a
different authentication server, the transaction will fail, and the
server can refuse to communicate further.  Because, in effect, this
forces all programs on the system to use the same authentication
server, we have designed its interface to make any safe operation
possible, and to include no extraneous operations.  (This is why
passwords are implemented in a different server.)


		THE PROCESS SERVER

The process server has undergone much change in the system design.
Originally it was to be responsible for much of the mechanics of
signal delivery, process creation and destruction, and so forth.  We
realized, however, that virtually all of these features did not need
to be in a global system server.

The process server, in the final design, acts as an information
categorization repository.  There are four main services supported by
the process server.

First, the process server keeps track of generic host-level
information not handled by the Mach kernel.  The hostname, the hostid,
the system version, and so forth are maintained by the process server.

Second, the process server maintains the Posix notions of sessions and
process groups, for the convenience of programs which wish to use
Posix features.

Third, the process server maintains a one-to-one mapping between tasks
and processes.  Every task is assigned a pid.  Processes can register
a message port with the process server, which will then be given out
to any other program which requests it.  The process server makes no
attempt to keep these message ports private, so user programs need to
implement whatever security they need themselves.  (The C Library,
which normally implements reception of messages on the message port,
provides convenient functions for doing so.)  Processes can tell the
process server their current argv and envp values; the process server
will then provide to those requesting it a vector of the arguments and
environment for any process.  This is useful in writing ps-like
programs, as well as making it easier to hide or change this
information.  None of these features is mandatory.  Programs are free
to disregard all of this if they wish, and never register themselves
with the process server at all.  They will still have a pid assigned,
however.

Finally, the process server implements "process collections", which
are used to collect a number of process message ports at the same
time.  Also, facilities are provided for converting between pids,
process server ports, and Mach task ports, all the while ensuring the
security of the ports managed.

It is important to stress that that the process server is optional.
Because of restrictions in Mach, programs must run as root in order to
identify all the tasks in the system, but given that, multiple process
servers could co-exist, each with their own clients, giving their own
model of the universe.  Those process server features which do not
require root privileges to be implemented could be done as per-user
servers, for those user programs which wish to do recordkeeping in
that fashion.  The user's hands are not tied.


		TRANSPARENT FTP

Transparent FTP is an intriguing idea whose time has come.  The
popular ange-ftp package available for GNU Emacs makes access to FTP
files virtually transparent to all the emacs file manipulation
functions.  Transparent FTP does the same thing, but in a system wide
fashion.  This server is not yet written; the details of its access
remain to be fleshed out, and will doubtless change when we have
experience using the server.

In a BSD kernel, a transparent FTP filesystem would be no harder to
write than it is in the Hurd.  But mention the idea to a BSD kernel
hacker, and the response is that "such a thing doesn't belong in the
kernel".  In a sense, this is correct.  It violates all the layering
principles of such a system to place such a thing in the kernel.  The
unfortunate side effect, however, is that the design methodology
(which is based on preventing users from changing things they don't
like) is being used to prevent system designers from making things
better.

In the Hurd, there are no obstacles to doing transparent FTP.  A
translator will be provided for the node /ftp.  The contents of /ftp
will not be directly listable, though further subdirectories will.
The will have a variety of possible formats.  If I want to access some
files on uunet, for example, I might do
`cd /ftp/ftp.uu.net:anonymous:mib@gnu'.  If I want to access some
files on an account I have elsewhere, I might do
`cd /ftp/unmvax.cs.unm.edu:mike:my-password-here'.  Parts of this
could be left out, and the transparent FTP program would read them
from my .netrc file.  In the last case, this would allow me to do
simply `cd /ftp/unmvax.cs.unm.edu'; the rest of the information is
present in my .netrc file already.

There is no need to do a `cd' first--I can use any file commands I
want.  If I want to implement RFC 1097 (the Telnet Subliminal Message
Option), I can just type `more /ftp/ftp.uu.net/inet/rfc/rfc1097'.  I
can use a copy command if I will need it frequently, or just directly
load the file into my emacs.


		FILESYSTEMS

We are implementing ordinary filesystems as well.  The initial release
of the system will contain a filesystem upward compatible with the
Fast File System as found in BSD 4.4.  In addition to the ordinary
semantics, we will provide the recording of translators, thirty-two
bit user ids and group ids, and a new id per file, called the "author"
of the file, which can be arbitrarily set by the owner.  In addition,
because users in the Hurd can have multiple uids, or even none, there
is an additional set of permission bits providing access control for
"unknown user" (no uids) as distinct from "known but arbitrary user"
(some uids).  The latter category is the existing "world" category of
file permissions.

We plan to implement the Network File System protocol, using the 4.4
BSD implementation as a starting point.  We will also implement a
log-structured filesystem, using the same ideas as the work at Sprite,
but probably not the same format.  We may design our own network file
protocol as well, or we may just extend NFS to rid it of deficiencies.
We will also implement various "little" filesystems, such as the MSDOS
filesystem, to help people move files between GNU and other operating
systems on the same hardware.


		TERMINALS

We will have an I/O server to implement the terminal semantics of
Posix.  The C Library has features for keeping track of the
controlling terminal and arranging to have the proper job control
signals sent at the proper times, as well as obeying keyboard and
hangup signals from the terminal driver.

Programs will be able to insert the terminal driver into
communications channels in a variety of ways.  Servers like rlogind,
for example, will be able to insert the terminal protocol onto their
network communication port.  Pseudo-terminals will not be necessary,
though the will be provided for backward compatibility with older
programs--no programs in GNU will depend on them.

Nothing about the terminal driver is forced upon users.  The terminal
driver allows a user to get at the underlying communications channel
easily, and to either bypass the terminal driver on an as-needed
basis, or entirely, or even substitute a different terminal
driver-like program.  In the latter case, provided the alternate
program implements the necessary interfaces, it will be used by the C
Library exactly as if it were the ordinary terminal driver.

Because of this flexibility, the original terminal driver will not
provide complex line editing features, restricting itself to the
behavior found in Posix and BSD.  We plan, eventually, to have a
readline-like terminal driver, which will provide complex line-editing
features for those users who wish to use it.

The terminal driver will probably not support high-volume rapid data
transmission (such as is required by UUCP or slip) very well.  Those
programs, however, do not need any of its features, and will be
modified to use the underlying Mach device ports for terminals, which
do efficiently support moving large amounts of data.


		EXECUTING PROGRAMS

The mechanics of implementing the execve call are distributed between
three programs.  The library handles marshalling the argument and
environment vectors.  It then sends a message to the file server
holding the file to be executed.  The file server checks execute
permissions, making whatever changes it desires in the exec call.  For
example, if the file is marked setuid and the fileserver has the
ability, it will change the user identification going to the new
image appropriately.  The file server also decides if programs which
had access to the old task should continue to have access to the new
task.  If the file server is augmenting permissions, or executing an
unreadable image, for example, then the exec needs to take place in a
new Mach task to maintain security.  (The process server contains some
special features to allow the new task to keep the pid of the old task
in this case, thus preserving Posix semantics.)

After deciding the policy associated with the new image, the
filesystem calls the exec server to load the task.  The exec server,
written using the GNU BFD (Binary File Descriptor) library, loads the
image.  BFD supports a large number of object file formats; almost any
object file format it supports will be executable.  The exec server
also recognizes scripts starting with `#!' and does the right thing
for them.

It was thought that it would be nice to make it easy for users to have
their own exec servers.  Roland McGrath thought of the following
technique.  The standard exec server also looks at the environment of
the new image; if it contains a variable EXEC_SERVERS then it uses the
programs specified there as exec servers instead of the system
default.  (This is, of course, not done for execs that the file server
has requested be kept secure.)

The new image starts running in the C Library, which sends a message
to the exec server to get the arguments, environment, and other state
(umask, current directory, etc.).  None of this additional state is
special to the file server or the exec server; if programs wish, they
can use it in a different manner than the C Library.


		NEW PROCESSES

The fork call is implemented almost entirely in the C Library.  The
new task is created by Mach kernel calls.  The C Library arranges to
have its image inherited properly.  The new task is registered with
the process server (though this is not mandatory).  The C Library
provides vectors of functions to be called at fork time: one vector to
be called before the fork, one after in the parent, and one after in
the child.  This should not be used to replace the normal sequence of
calling fork; it is intended for libraries which need to close ports
or clean up lock state before a fork occurs.  The library will
implement both fork calls specified by the draft Posix.4a (the threads
extension to the real-time extension).

Nothing forces the user to create new tasks this way.  If a program
wants to use almost the normal fork, but with some special
characteristics, then it can do so.  Hooks will be provided by the C
Library; in addition, the function can even be completely replaced if
desired.  None of this is possible in a Unix system.


		ASYNCHRONOUS MESSAGES

As mentioned above, the process server maintains a "message port" for
each task registered with it.  These ports are public, and are used to
send asynchronous messages to the task.  Signals, for example, are
sent to the message port.  The signal message also provides a port as
an indication that the sender should be trusted to send the signal.
The C Library maintains a variety of ports in a table, each of which
identifies a set of signals that can be sent by anyone who posesses
that port.  For example, if the user possess the task's kernel port,
it is allowed to send any signal.  If the user possesses a special
"terminal id" port, it is allowed to send the keyboard and hangup
signals.  Users can add arbitrary new entries into the C Libraries
signal permissions table.

When a process's process group changes, the process server will send
it a message indicating the new process group.  In this case, the
process server proves its authority by providing the task's kernel
port.

The library also implements messages to add and delete uids currently
used by the process.  If new uids are sent to the program, the library
adds them to its current set, and then exchanges message with all the
I/O servers it knows about, proving to them its new authorization.
Similarly, uids can be deleted with a message.  In the latter case,
the caller must provide the process's task port.  (You can't harm a
process by giving it extra permission, but you can harm it by taking
permission away.)  We will provide user programs to send these
messages to processes.  This will enable the `su' command to cause all
the programs in your current login session to gain a new uid, rather
than spawn a subshell.

The library will allow programs to add asynchronous messages they wish
to recognize, as well as prevent recognition of the standard set.


		MAKING IT LOOK LIKE UNIX

The C Library will implement all the calls from BSD and Posix, as well
as some obvious extensions to them.  This enables users to replace
those calls they dislike, or bypass them entirely, whereas in Unix,
the calls must be used "as they come", with no alternatives possible.

On some environments, we will support binary compatibility as well.
This works by building a special version of the library.  This is then
loaded somewhere in the address space of the process.  (On, a Vax, for
example, it would be tucked in above the stack.)  A feature of Mach,
called system call redirection is then used to trap Unix system calls
and turn them into jumps into this special version of the library.
(On almost all machines, the cost of such a redirection is very small;
this is a highly optimized path of Mach.  On a 386 it's about two
dozen instructions.)  This is only slightly worse than a simple
procedure call.

Many features of Unix, such as signal masks and vectors, are handled
completely by the library.  This makes such calls significantly
cheaper than in Unix.  It is now reasonable to use sigblock
extensively to protect critical sections, rather than seeking out some
other, less expensive method.


		NETWORK PROTOCOLS

We are writing a library that will make it very easy to port 4.4 BSD
protocol stacks into the Hurd.  This will enable operation, virtually
for free, of all the protocols supported by BSD.  Currently, this
includes the CCITT protocols, the TCP/IP protocols, the Xerox NS
protocols, and the ISO protocols.

For maximal performace, some work would be necessary to take advantage
of Hurd features that provide for very high speed I/O.  Generally, for
most protocols, this would require some thought, but not too much
time.  We intend to spend effort making the TCP/IP protocols run as
efficiently as possible.

As an interesting example of the flexibility of the Hurd design,
consider the case of IP trailers, used extensively in BSD for
performance.  While the Hurd will be willing to send and receive
trailers, it will gain fairly little advantage in doing so, because
there is no requirement that data be copied *ever*, so avoiding copies
for page-aligned data is not important.

Those of you who have been playing with Thomas on Gambit
may be happy to hear that Gambit 2.0 has been released.
You can now get a copy from the usual server (trex, see below)
or from cambridge.apple.com:/pub/dylan/gambit/.

The only extra thing available at cambridge that isn't at trex
is the file "thomas-1.1-interp.hqx", which contains a double-clickable
Thomas 1.1 interpreter already built on macgambit 2.0.

Below is Marc's announcement of Gambit 2.0:

Subject: Gambit release 2.0

This message is to announce release 2.0 of Gambit.  We had problems a
few weeks back with our FTP server trex.iro.umontreal.ca, but now
things are back to normal.  You will find the UNIX and Macintosh
versions in the directory pub/gambit/gambit-2.0 .

The content of the directory is:

  gambit20.tar.Z                   Gambit Scheme System for M680x0 based
                                   computers running UNIX.

  macgambit-2.0-interpreter.hqx    MacGambit interpreter and sample programs.

  macgambit-2.0-sources1.hqx       Files required to build interpreter
                                   and compiler using THINK-C 5.0.

  macgambit-2.0-sources2.hqx       Scheme source files for runtime and
                                   compiler.  Also contains DEC's Thomas
                                   interpreter (a Dylan lookalike).


Note: all these files are (c) 1992-93, Universite de Montreal.


There have been minor changes to the UNIX version.  For those running
X11, you can build a version of the interpreter that includes a simple
graphics environment.  Simply do a: make BIN/gsi-x11
in the gambit/targets/m68000 directory (check src/gsi/sierpinsky.scm
for an example).

The Macintosh version can now be configured with a different memory
partition.  The user selects the amount of memory to reserve for the
Scheme heap, the Scheme code area (where programs are loaded), and the
Macintosh heap (where space is allocated for editor windows, desk
accessories, etc).  Use the "Memory Partition..." item in the "Edit" menu.

We hope you will enjoy this new release.

Since 1989, many people have asked whether Cygnus planned to give
money to the FSF, and many people assumed (incorrectly) that we did
contribute some fraction of revenues or profits.  Indeed we are
selfishly glad that we did not make such a commitment, because our
profit margins in the first 3 years were small enough that almost any
commitment would have left us in red ink.

But now times have changed.  We are by no means an overwhelmingly
profitable company, but we are stable, and we are now able to budget
money to be donated to the FSF.  Another difference is that in 1989,
the FSF had reasonable funding for its staff (far more than Cygnus had
for its staff).  Because of the recession, new companies that undercut
FSF's already low tape distribution charges, and an increasing
assumption that the FSF has enough support from other sources, the
once-reliable source of FSF funding is now unacceptably low.

We have decided to make our donation in such a way as to encourage
other donations, and to serve as a corporate model so that other
companies will do likewise.  We hope this action will bootstrap the
FSF funding effort and avert the impending crisis.  Without further
ado, here is the announcement:

**** ==== PLEASE POST ==== **** $$$$ **** ==== PLEASE POST ==== ****

		Cygnus Support 1993 FSF Matching Fund

To encourage cash donations to the Free Software Foundation, Cygnus
Support has established a 1993 FSF Matching Fund for all employees,
customers, and employees of customers.

Donations made by Cygnus employees will be matched equally up to a
maximum of $1000 per employee.  Cygnus will also match donations from
customers and their employees at 50% to a maximum of $1000 per
customer.

The FSF Matching Fund will be capped annually on the basis of business
conditions, to be determined by Cygnus Support.  The cap for 1993 has
been set to $10,000.

Donations payable to the Free Software Foundation should be sent to
Cygnus Support, where they will be matched and forwarded to the FSF
each quarter.  The FSF will provide the contributor with a receipt to
recognize the contribution (which is tax-deductable).  Donations sent
to the FSF directly will not be matched, except by prior arrangement
with Cygnus Support.

We hope that this action not only encourages our employees and
customers to contribute to the FSF, but that it will also encourage
other companies to establish similar matching programs.

We also hope that when companies have a choice of where to buy
commercial support for free software, they recognize Cygnus as a
positive, proactive force in the free software community (as well as a
competent organization...).  We would like to reward our customers by
giving their employees the chance to participate to greater advantage
in the success of free software.

gzip version 1.0.3 is available for anonymous ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu
[18.71.0.38], in the files /pub/gnu/gzip-1.0.3.tar or gzip-1.0.3.shar.

gzip (GNU zip) is a compression utility designed to be a replacement
for 'compress'. Its main advantages over compress are much better
compression and freedom from patented algorithms.  The GNU Project
has adopted it as the standard compression program for its system.


Notable changes from version 0.8.1 are (see the NEWS file in the
distribution for a more complete list and the file ChangeLog for
a detailed list):

o gzip now runs on Vax/VMS and Amiga

o many improvements in znew (convert .Z file to gzip .z format)

o Added env variable GZIP for default options. Example:
   for sh:   GZIP="-8 -v"; export GZIP
   for csh:  setenv GZIP "-8 -v"

o Added gzexe to compress rarely used executables.

o Reduce memory usage (required for MSDOS and useful on all systems).

o Support the test option -t for compressed (.Z) files.
  Allow some data recovery for bad .Z files.

o Added makefiles for MSDOS

o Many small bug fixes and portability improvements


Some persons have had problems with tar extracting files with
incorrect time stamps (such as dates in the future). In this case,
just do:

  touch *; touch configure; configure; make

Several persons have reported that gunzip could not extract
certain .Z files. In all cases, the files turned out to be
really damaged. You can use "gzip -vt *.Z" to check all your .Z
files, and "gzip -cd bad.Z > bad" to recover up to the failure point.

Some persons have reported that compress sometimes compresses better
than gzip. This occurs only on large redundant files. You can use
"znew -K" to keep the .Z file in this case.

This message is to announce release 2.0 of Gambit.  We had problems a
few weeks back with our FTP server trex.iro.umontreal.ca, but now
things are back to normal.  You will find the UNIX and Macintosh
versions in the directory pub/gambit/gambit-2.0 .

The content of the directory is:

  gambit20.tar.Z                   Gambit Scheme System for M680x0 based
                                   computers running UNIX.

  macgambit-2.0-interpreter.hqx    MacGambit interpreter and sample programs.

  macgambit-2.0-sources1.hqx       Files required to build interpreter
                                   and compiler using THINK-C 5.0.

  macgambit-2.0-sources2.hqx       Scheme source files for runtime and
                                   compiler.  Also contains DEC's Thomas
                                   interpreter (a Dylan lookalike).


Note: all these files are (c) 1992-93, Universite de Montreal.


There have been minor changes to the UNIX version.  For those running
X11, you can build a version of the interpreter that includes a simple
graphics environment.  Simply do a: make BIN/gsi-x11
in the gambit/targets/m68000 directory (check src/gsi/sierpinsky.scm
for an example).

The Macintosh version can now be configured with a different memory
partition.  The user selects the amount of memory to reserve for the
Scheme heap, the Scheme code area (where programs are loaded), and the
Macintosh heap (where space is allocated for editor windows, desk
accessories, etc).  Use the "Memory Partition..." item in the "Edit" menu.

We hope you will enjoy this new release.

I've ported GNU Make 3.60 and RCS 5.6 to VAX/VMS.  If you would like
copies of either of these utilities, please send me e-mail at
mike@mathworks.com.  RCS works with Multinet NFS mounted Unix file
systems as well as VMS file systems.

They haven't been fully tested, but I use them a LOT and they seem
to work fine for everything I use them for.  VMS implementation
notes, etc. are also included.  If anyone wants, I'll post the VMS
readme files here.

      [ Though this program is not currently part of GNU, FSF is
	publishing an announcement of it, as it is useful free
	software. ]

This was announced back in January.  I am posting it again
because the files are now archived at a different site.




                  Announcing aegis version 1.3

The latest version of aegis, a project change supervisor,
is now available.  Testers Wanted.

Some of you may recall previous versions of aegis, announced in
this newsgroup and others.  If you have never heard of it, the
README file is attached, below.

This software is still alpha, but any and all comments are
eagerly sought.  Please pick it up and have a look at it if you
have the time.

Don't let the "ALPHA" put you off.  As one person said "how can it
be alpha, it compiles!"  It is alpha because it needs more exposure
to real world situations, and because the User Guide needs more work
(the manual entries are complete).


                     Where to get aegis.1.3

You can get the latest version by anonymous ftp from
	Host:	ftp.cse.nau.edu (134.114.64.70)
	Dir:	/pub/Aegis
	File:	aegis.1.3.tar.Z		# the complete source
	File:	aegis.1.3.patch.Z	# patch to take 1.2 to 1.3
	File:	aegis.1.3.ps.Z		# PostScript of the User Guide

To use anonymous ftp, give "anonymous" as the user name
(omit the quotes) and your email address as the password.

My grateful thanks to Paul Balyoz <pab@ftp.cse.nau.edu>
for his generosity in providing this archive space.

This directory also contains a few other pieces of software written by
me.  Some are referred to in the aegis documentation.  Please have a look
if you are interested.

For those of you without ftp, I recommend the use of an
ftp-by-email server.  Here is a list of a few (there are
many more):
	mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu
	ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
	ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au
In general, you can get a help message about how to use
each system by sending email with a subject of "help" and
a message body containing just the word "help".



                       The README file, or
               What the heck is this aegis thing?

NAME
	Aegis - a project change supervisor
	Copyright (c) 1990-1993 Peter Miller.
	All rights reserved.

	aegis (ee.j.iz) n., a protection, a defence.

	The aegis program is distributed under the terms of the GNU
	General Public License.  See the LICENSE section, below, for
	more details.

ALPHA NOTICE
	Please note that this is Alpha software.  It probably has
	bugs, it is known to have unimplemented features.  This
	version is not intended to be the final product.  For more
	information, see the ALPHA file included in this release.

DESCRIPTION
	The aegis program is a CASE tool with a difference.  In the
	spirit of the UNIX Opertaing System, the aegis program is a
	small component designed to work with other programs.

	Many CASE systems attempt to provide everything, from bubble
	charts to source control to compilers.  Users are trapped
	with the components supplied by the CASE system, and if you
	don't like one of the components (it may be too limited, for
	instance), then that is just tough.

	In contrast, UNIX provides many components of a CASE system
	- compilers, editors, dependency tools (such as make),
	source control (such as SCCS).  You may substitute the tool
	of your choice - gcc, jove, cake, rcs (to name a few) if you
	don't like the ones supplied with the system.  The aegis
	program adds to this list with software configuration
	management (SCM), and true to UNIX philosophy, the aegis
	program does not dictate the choice of any of the other
	tools (although it may stretch them to their limits).

	Enough hype, what is it that this Aegis program does?  Just
	what is software configuration management?  This question is
	sufficiently broad as to require a book in answer.  In
	essence, the aegis program is a project change supervisor.
	It provides a framework within which a team of developers
	may work on many changes to a program independently, and the
	aegis program coordinates integrating these changes back
	into the master source of the program, with as little
	disruption as possible.  Resolution of contention for source
	files, a major headache for any project with more than one
	developer, is one of the aegis program's major functions.

	It should be noted that the aegis program is a developer's
	tool, in the same sense as make or SCCS are developer's
	tools.  It is not a manager's tool - it does not provide
	progress tracking or help with work allocation.

BENEFITS
	So why should you use the aegis program?

	The aegis program uses a particular model of the development
	of software projects.  This model has a master source (or
	baseline) of a project, and a team of developers creating
	changes to be made to this baseline.  When a change is
	complete, it is integrated with the baseline, to become the
	new baseline.  Each change must be atomic and self-
	contained, no change is allowed to cause the baseline to
	cease to work.  "Working" is defined as passing it's own
	tests.  The tests are considered part of the baseline.  The
	aegis program provides support for the developer so that an
	entire copy of the baseline need not be taken to change a
	few files, only those files which are to be changed need to
	be copied.

	The win in using the aegis program is that there are O(n)
	interactions between developers and the baseline.  Contrast
	this with a master source which is being edited directly by
	the developers - there are O(n!) interactions between
	developers - this makes adding "just one more" developer a
	potential disaster.

	Another win is that the project baseline always works.
	Always having a working baseline means that a version is
	always available for demonstrations, or those "pre-release
	snapshots" we are always forced to provide.

	The above advantages are all very well - for management
	types.  Why should Joe Average Programmer use the aegis
	program?  Recall that SCCS provides file locking, but only
	for one file at a time.  The aegis program provides the file
	locking, atomically, for the set of files in the change.
	Recall also that SCCS locks the file the instant you start
	editing it.  This makes popular files a project bottleneck.
	The aegis program allows concurrent editing, and a
	resolution mechanism just before the change must be
	integrated, meaning fewer delays for J.A.Programmer.

NEW IN THIS RELEASE
	A number of features have been added to aegis with this
	release.  A few of them are detailed here:

	+ Support for NFS and the automounter.  The aegis program
	will now function correctly in this environment.

	+ Generation of patch files.  The aegis program now provides
	functionailty for the generation of patch files.  An example
	shell script may be found in the aux/patches.sh file.

	+ Extracting previous versions.  It is now possible to
	extract an historical version of a file when copying a file
	into change, not just the most up-to-date version.  This
	aids in reproducing and killing bugs.

	+ The tests distributed with the aegis program now use RCS.
	Previously SCCS was used, but this costs money and thus not
	everyone had it.  RCS is free software and more readily
	accessible and far less expensive.

	Plus the usual crop of bug fixes and tinkering.  For
	excruciating detail, and also acknowlegements of those who
	generously sent me feedback, please see the CHANGES file
	included in this distribution.

BUILDING
	Instructions on how to build and test the aegis program are
	to be found in the BUILDING file included with this release.
