	* descrip.mms: Fix rules for creating .icx files.  Add
	short_test.lis and long_test.lis targets for testing.

	* mxrejsum.icn (usage): created.

	(main): added -i and -version flags, call usage if error in
	command line arguments.  Print file names if verbose.

	(record statistics): renamed rej to reject, drej to dreject, added
	relay, drelay, renamed mbox to frombox, added tobox, added bl for
	black lists.

	(process_file): created ipset and hostset to get rid of cset
	concatenation for every line.  At user specified intervals print a
	dot in verbose mode.  Keep track of spam discarded by disabled
	relay using stats.relay and stats.drelay.  Fix matching of mailbox
	names so that they are separated into originating and receiving
	mailboxes.  Fix matching of ip addresses so missing IP address
	doesn't save junk.  Add matching and tracking of blacklists that
	report hits.

	(write_statistics): General rewording of messages.  Only say
	"Top <n>" if size of table is greater than <n>.  Don't print
	headers for empty tables.  Print relay, to mailbox, and blacklist
	statistics.
